# jnitrace Change Log

## 1.0.8
- Fixed linter errors when running eslint typescript

## 1.0.7
- Bumped all dependency versions to the latest

## 1.0.6
- Bump version of minimilist to fix vulnerability CVE-2020-7598

## 1.0.5
- Bug fix for config options. In previous versions any config settings were ignored, including which library to trace. This version ensures the engine uses the config options provided
- Added logging to record if a method is called without jnitrace-engine having seen the corresponding methodID

## 1.0.3
- Bug fix for the GetStringChars method. jnitrace now expects a char* return rather than a char
- Bug fix to change the argument list used to the original args, rather than the cloned ones in a normal JNI intercept
