The main thing is to believe in your strength and never give up!\n\nAuthor’s introduction\n\nOnce I naively thought that it was necessary to read the text from the first word to the last, syllable by syllable, letter by letter. I diligently read into every word, trying to catch its essence, ignoring the general meaning of the text block. It looked like the following:\n\nThe text from the economic article “Economics close is the study of how people interact with each other and with their natural surroundings in producing their livelihoods, and how this changes over time” sounded in my head something like that: “He-re is Ed-ward Be-ar, com-ing down-stai-rs now, bump – bump – bump - on the back of his he-ad be-hind Chri-sto-pher Ro-bin\"...\n\nI supposed the effectiveness of the reading is composed of thoughtful reading, retelling and mental analysis, which the text goes undergoes.\n\nBy the way, did you notice how the second text was difficult to read? How does the eye stumble on each divider? Looking back, it seems to me that I was almost mentally retarded.\n\nAt the same time, I was quite stubborn. It seemed to me that my understanding of the reading process was as correct as put two and two together. Low reading speed didn’t seem to me something out of the ordinary.\n\nAbout five years ago, just happened to, I came across an advertisement for speed reading courses, where just only in two months I was promised astonishing two hundred times of reading speed increase. Being a rather strong skeptic, I decided to study that proposition and was not quite satisfied.\n\nThe courses consisted of ten lessons, which, as you understand, are not quite effective. For a couple of classes, I just realized that I did not understand anything. I decided that if I want to master the technique of speed reading, I must use my main weapon – persistence. Because, you know, I'm really good at it.\n\nSo, instead of spending money on expensive courses, I downloaded several books and began to study from scratch.\n\nDuring the study of literature, I realized the slower I read, the less I perceive information. I persistently tried to complete the simulators, but I understood that I was stuck at a certain point and could not move on. Due to the endless unsystematic exercises my eyes began to get tired at the end of the day. After several hours of training, my head constantly started to hurt and any will to go further dropped all the way to zero.\n\nThe technique of speed reading ran out of interest to me. After several months of inactivity, I returned to the old level.\n\nNevertheless, the issues of brain activity and possibilities still fascinated me. I studied articles about the results successful people, who have achieved the results by reading more than a hundred books a year. Former persistence came back as soon as I saw examples that inspired me to continue working.\n\nHowever, I decided to approach the question not in terms of the classes quantity, but in terms of quality. I identified several reference points that I had to correct in the technique of my slow reading speed.\n\nThe answers were not easy to get, but they became the basis of this book and program. Thanks to my own developments, which have become a quite successful application, I have mastered many skills that are useful for speed reading!\n\nFirstly, I decided to act immediately, because I realized the value of each day in mastering speed reading skills. Secondly, I made the classes systematic, i.e. types of simulators and time for their passage became streamlined. And most importantly, I dropped all sorts of doubts about my own strengths and abilities. I repeated to myself the phrase breaking any walls: \"I can.\"\n\nGradually, the reading speed began to increase. After several months, I was able to easily read a rather huge article from the field of my professional activity (it is related to the construction business). I quickly received information, but noticed that I was not getting any pleasure, since I had to keep several important conditions at the control: read paragraphs, analyze the text, memorize it, delve into the essence. It was really exhausting.\n\nI remember how, for the sake of diversity, I took up a small interesting book, but on the fifth chapter I noticed that I swallowed those fascinating lines in a matter of minutes, but did not receive a single drop of satisfaction from the author's wonderful style. At this moment I brought out the third, and a very important postulate – everything that I do at a particular moment in my life should bring joy. Fun. Euphoria\n\nSince then, more than three years passed. Speed reading became my outlet. I decided to share the secrets of this fascinating and truly rewarding activity with everyone who seeks how to improve their lives. Having mastered a large number of trainings and exercises, I developed my own simulators, which became the basis for the speed reading application.\n\nSeeing how are popular my designs, I decide not to stop at what had been achieved and create the book “Speed reading: all the secrets in one book”. It is a more advanced material with interesting facts, stories and practices.\n\nMy most important goal is not only to assist in targeting an immense amount of information in the form of various text formats, but also to change the total understanding of the reader’s world.\n\nEach section of the book is aimed to improve such qualities as concentration, memory, attention, reading technique (getting rid of articulation and regression). The old model of thinking will gradually be squeezed out by the new speed of processing information flows coming from various, not only textual sources.\n\nThe most important thing, in my opinion, in this book is that it eliminates many fears – the fear of failure, self-doubt. And again, I would like to note, the scope of my work is very far from scientific. I am not an expert in psychology or philology, but practical experience combined with knowledge gained from hundreds of thousands of sources, gave me the opportunity to share with you the secrets of speed reading.\n\nYou can apply this knowledge both in reading and in everyday life. For example, I became more attentive driver, stopped to get tired after long hours of hard work process. Now I have time to enjoy the amazing works of the classics before bedtime. I feel the taste of life and better understand people around me.\n\nFinally, I want to offer my readers a few simple rules, thanks to which the development of the program proposed in the book will become much simpler and more pleasant:\n\nBelieve in your strength. Do not underestimate self-esteem. Remember – you are endless in your abilities. Your bar must be high.\n\nDrop bad habits. Slowness and doubt will not help overcome obstacles. Do not be afraid to fight them.\n\nDon’t think categorically. It is impossible to get everything here and now. Choose your tempo. Imaginary perfectionism will only delay your efforts. Enjoy the process.\n\nTrust the inner sensations and intuitions.\n\nStop being nervous. Relax right now.\n\nDrop the rush.\n\nStart right now.\n\nI believe in you and wish you a pleasant reading.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to scientists, the amount of information absorbed by the average person has increased fivefold over the past thirty years. Dr. Martin Gilbert of the University of Southern California conducted research that showed, about a hundred years ago, most people could read only 50 books in their entire life! However, along with the expansion of scientific disciplines, the increase in print products, the development of information technology, humanity gained access to an unlimited amount of information, which triggered a real brain race for leadership in the field of knowledge.\n\nIn the 21st century, operational perception and processing of material from the most diverse areas is a key factor for success.\n\nThrough reading, a person receives not only useful information, but also expands the vocabulary, develops a culture of speech. In the process of reading, the brain actively forms new neural connections, which contributes to an increase in the speed of thinking, an increase in the reaction rate and the formation of so-called “mainstream thinking” – the ability to capture the link between data from different areas to obtain effective conclusions.\n\nWe can safely say, that reading is a kind of simulator for the brain development. Each read book becomes one more step to achieve the goal – mastering a new profession, raising qualification, defeating competitors.\n\nHow to succeed in such a fast-paced competition for the information leadership?\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a French ophthalmologist, Émile Javal, identified a person’s field of view that exceeded the standards of that time. This was done as part of the study of the reading process, when the scientist noticed that the reader does not focus on each letter, but “swallows” the line with stopping only 4 times. On the basis of this discovery, the first articles about speed reading method began to appear. The first courses on the new methodology were based at the United States Syracuse University in 1925.\n\nSpeed ​​reading implies quick perception of textual material due to special techniques. The average reading speed of an adult person varies according to different sources from 120 to 200 words per minute, however, thanks to the speed reading this skill can be developed to an unlimited number. You will read as fast as you wish!\n\nINTERESTING FACT! Howard Berg is considered the fastest reader in the world. \"The Guinness World Record Book\" recognized Berg in 1990 for his ability to read more than 25,000 words per minute and write more than 100 words per minute. So, you see, that’s real!\n\nHowever, the question is still open – how speed reading is compatible with the qualitative perception and analysis of the information received?\n\nUntil now, it’s believed that the speed reading causes significant essence loss of the read text. Concentrating on speed, a person “disconnects” from semantic content. The solution of this issue led to research in this area and writing a separate book.\n\nAny difficult task has its own solution, achieved through the use of innovative techniques. They allow you to develop concentration and memory– the basis for meaningful perception of the text. If we add awareness, memorization, critical assessment and analysis to the speed reading technique, we can reach a new level, designated as super reading.\n\nUsing this “recipe” will allow you to be at the very epicenter of information flows, that will be increasing every day: while standing in a traffic jam for an hour you will be able to easily read a scientific journal, study the latest marketing research on the way to work, run through all of lecture notes in minutes before the exam.\n\nSpecially selected exercises described in this book significantly increase not only the speed of reading any text, but also the quality of its assimilation.\n\n\nPart I. Inspiration\n\nWhat does our life consist of? Two plans – a routine activity, associated, as a rule, with work and daily hassle and entertainment, recreation, something, that can distract us from the dullness of everyday life. Happy people experience a sense of satisfaction by combining both plans; with the same drive, they do the cleaning and go hiking. Some have to go to the boring work only to maintain a stable standard of living.\n\nThe first are looking for inspiration. The second are looking for motivation.\n\nThe first part of this book is designed to generate enthusiasm that will turn reading into an exciting journey to the hidden possibilities of the human brain. The information breakthrough at the end of the 20th century created the conditions for the global development of human activity in the field of science and art. Does this fact generate the excitement of consumption and the study of information about our multifaceted world?\n\nAs the saying goes, the appetite comes with eating. It’s enough to read the first line of a fascinating detective story or a popular science article, as we find ourselves drawn into an information centrifuge.\n\nMost people today have mastered the skills of slow reading perfectly – with the mental vocal reproduction of each word, with giving the text emotional coloring. Perhaps, that this process is suitable for fiction, which is savored bit by bit, like a chocolate bar, but what if you need to learn dozens of pages of necessary information per night?\n\nSpeed ​​reading will allow everyone, who has studied the material below to become a step higher in their efforts to conquer top life positions. Just imagine, that thanks to this skill you will be able to achieve what millions of inhabitants of the planet dream of!\n\nToday body shaping is popular. Fitness coaches and nutrition instructors call for this, offering the only motivation – to please yourself and others. This is a powerful incentive, forcing even the laziest to get up from the couch and train muscles for several hours a day. But the brain is also a muscle!\n\nTrained brain no less contributes to the achievement of vocation. Inspired by the examples in this section of the book, you will be able to gain self-confidence, discover the unlimited possibilities of your mind and make sure that you and only you can radically change your life!\n\n\nChapter 1. Who Needs Speed reading and Why?\n\nQuite possibly, stumbling on this manual online, you will ask a logical question, why study speed reading, if for my activities I have enough studying several books in a year and one magazine and several newspapers per month?\n\nLet's analyze the flow of information daily passing through our worldview. According to information experts, the material on the web is updated almost every second. Every day, scientists make a breakthrough in a particular area. Data is growing exponentially. Track updated data is becoming increasingly difficult. It is necessary to create a base for the absorption and productive assimilation of large flows of text messages. This can be done throughout life. Consider each stage separately.\n\nFor example, you are a student or a future applicant. At this interval of age, the brain is the most flexible for the formation of skills, the implementation of which will develop in the future. The foundation can be laid now! Effective speed reading helps not only to quickly learn school literature or materials for admission, but also to assimilate, and most importantly, to memorize the necessary knowledge in the shortest possible time.\n\nIMPORTANT TO REMEMBER! Already in the third and fourth grades, slow reading is formed and, if it is not developed, you can get stuck for a long time at this level!\n\nAnd now, having come out of your own alma mater, you see before you an immense field of activity in which you are going to make a revolution. You are a young specialist with a huge suitcase of knowledge and skills, but are you ready for real life?\n\nBack in the middle of the last century, workers who could perform their function well – to process material or reduce debit with credit were considered the most valuable specialists. Most of today's professions contain a wide field of industry knowledge. Marketers need to understand foreign policy, and the knowledge of several foreign languages ​​can be useful to the medical profession.\n\n! The future does not come tomorrow. Your future is what you do today.\n\nUsually most of companies offer their employees internal training that extends over several months. How much faster you can join the workflow, if the material is mastered in just a couple of days!\n\nPsychologists have proven that after five years of being in the workplace, the process of professional burnout begins. The work seems boring, monotonous, uninteresting. Many factors are annoying. First of all, it concerns informational stagnation – the brain receives the same amount of similar data every day and begins to “starve”.\n\nBefore it was enough to graduate, and the knowledge gained was sufficient until retirement. Currently, to be in trend, you need to constantly improve and obtain new knowledge. Without quick mastering of information, becoming successful is quite difficult.\n\nSpeed ​​reading skills help to correct this situation – the quick processing of new material in a particular area will force you to rethink the experience gained and make significant progress in an already familiar professional environment. Thanks to the flow of information, you get a significant head start in front to your employees and increase the chance of getting a promotion several times!\n\nIt is all the more difficult to remain in leadership positions, because without a daily analysis of recent surveys, without developing new management concepts and without studying the competing environment, moving up is almost impossible. Accepting and working through this information, you will see how much wider you start to think about, which facets open for you in terms of development.\n\nDo you like to read? How much do you like to read? Do you not part with a paper or e-book, even in the subway? On a day off, are you organizing marathons to swallow your favorite pieces? Properly assimilated speed reading will help you to penetrate Bukowski’s volume in one weekend, read Dan Brown’s novel, know the denouement of the detective masterpiece from Conan Doyle in one gulp.\n\nSpeed ​​reading at all stages of life brings what we crave the most – self-reliance. Each page read becomes one more step to the top of our capabilities. Memorizing and processing information, you learn, and, as you know, knowledge is an endless process.\n\nAs soon as you start exercising with simulators, you will realize how much the pace of your life has increased. The quality of your mind will make you move at a new speed. Many things will leave your life – lounge procrastination, lazy evenings on weekdays, sluggish weekends, endless watching TV series.\n\nAnd you should not be afraid of change. Together with the speed reading skill, you will get much more – a chance to improve the productivity of life, to achieve your goals, to be not a victim of circumstances that you think interfere with the fulfillment of a dream, but to be the coordinator on the way to reaching the top.\n\n! It’s easy to change life, but it’s hard to start.\n\n\nChapter 2. Speed ​​reading: Learning to Read from Scratch\n\nRemember the last thing you read. How fast was the text read? How many facts and names did you remember? How clearly can you reproduce the content of the article or story?\n\nI am sure the results will not seem satisfactory.\n\nThe fact is that our thinking, that is, information processing, is significantly ahead of the speed of slow reading – by the whole word. On average, a person reads a page of text in 2 minutes, and it takes up to 30 seconds to understand the content. What do we do the rest of the time? We are distracted.\n\nFor example, you need to read a scientific publication. You study the information at your usual speed. A certain number of words for half a minute. But! In the intervening seconds, the brain begins to search hard for what else you can draw your attention. You inevitably start to remember the events of the day, make plans for the evening, distribute finances or think about your loved one. Thread read lost.\n\nMost readers note that it is often necessary to read one paragraph several times and still not catch the main idea.\n\nHence the following problem – the text becomes boring, \"not catchy.\" From repeated distractions to external objects, the brain ceases to perceive material – and we lose interest in it. Boredom breeds fatigue, which is why we don’t want to read at all.\n\nThis can be clearly demonstrated with examples from school life. Pupils find it difficult to start reading books and textbooks, because they are confident in advance that the text will be difficult and tedious to read. But what if whole paragraphs can be read at the speed that does not allow to be distracted by external objects?\n\nTo better understand the above statements, we turn to our reality. Popular social networks: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube. What is the principle of the informational presentation of these sites? Minimum text, maximum visual content. It is much easier to watch short videos or scroll through countless pictures and photos, read posts of 140 characters. Studies have shown that only a small percentage of the audience reads the description that accompanies the image.\n\nOur thinking is a multi-lane highway through which thoughts run at different speeds. If we are guided by this comparison, the internal dialogue rushes at a speed of 120 km\/h, and the reading process weaves 40 ...\n\nDuring the day our brain is overloaded with information, it gets tired and needs rest. Who wants to learn the works of Stephen Hawking after a busy nine-hour working day?\n\nBut who said that the speed limiters cannot be removed?\n\nSpeed ​​reading equalizes the speed of perception with the reading of the text. It’s a kind of fuel that feeds the mental structure of our brain. However, speed reading is not limited only to the speedy study of information, to mindlessly swallowing line by line.\n\nThe innovation technology of this book is reduced to the removal of speed reading to a qualitatively new level, suggesting a meaningful speed reading, designed in the reading process to process what has been read, structure it, draw conclusions and memorize. Thus, you get the superpower of any text to make it fun and desirable for reading.\n\nIn 1958, the Evelyn Wood Dynamic Reading School appeared, which laid the foundation for subsequent developments with an expanded base of exercises and training. The researcher excluded the use of the device to increase the speed of reading, highlighting the key idea – speed reading should be practiced in natural conditions. The result of the new methodology exceeded all expectations – Evelyn taught 12 senators of the United States of America to read quickly! In addition, its development has been successfully used in training courses at Harvard.\n\nThere were, of course, critics of speed reading art. The main postulate was a significant loss of the meaning of what was read, i.e. speed to the detriment of meaning. We will focus on refuting this conclusion.\n\nTry to move away from your usual reading patterns. Imagine, that you learn this skill from scratch. Cube by cube, starting from the base, a new type of reading will be built into the pyramid, at the peak of which will be the most valuable speed reading skills.\n\nWithout the destruction of the old building, it is impossible to build a new building. It is worth remembering at least the comic situation, when at the first lesson at the university students are asked to forget what they studied at school, and after graduation the employer strongly recommends discarding everything that was mastered at the university.\n\nConsider that this book is a guide to building a new house. Only this house is in your head.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n“Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune”, Jim Rohn\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nWhat makes an ordinary person different from a successful professional?\n\nSuppose designer X has the task of developing a project for a loft-style restaurant. The same challenge is facing designer Y. Both have the appropriate education and experience. Both are allotted the same amount of time to prepare the sketches.\n\nSo X gets to work. First, he drinks a cup of coffee, opens and runs the program. After working for about five minutes, he goes out to smoke and discuss pressing problems with his colleagues. Returning to work, he is distracted by incoming calls, then decides to check email. It's lunchtime. After a short snack, the work is stopped, because thoughts are busy planning the upcoming Friday evening. X decides to study the events and the availability of tables in his favorite pub. The project hangs at the initial development stage. The designer has one foot in the weekend. He doesn’t want to think about work at all. However, Saturday and Sunday he anxiously waits for Monday, because Boss will be clearly unhappy. It’s becoming more and more difficult to proceed with the design, since there is a chance that he will not be able to cope the order. And there is no time for revision and processing. Snowball. Vicious circle.\n\nLet us now turn to designer Y. Having drunk an invigorating mug of coffee, he turns off the phone, closes the tab with the mail, and plunges into the design process. When colleagues address to him, he politely asks not to interfere with the working process. After half an hour, Y decides to take a short break, comes out to get some fresh air and returns to building walls and ceilings. By lunchtime, some of the work has already been done, there was inspiration, so after a quick bite of the sandwich, Y “dives” into work with passion. By the end of Friday, the lion’s share of the project is completed; on Monday, it remains to tweak the sketch a bit and show it to the customer. There is time for refinement, the mood for the upcoming weekend is great. He is satisfied and proud of himself. The Boss is preparing bonus.\n\nWhat is the difference between the approaches that guided X and Y? What ensures the success of the second and the failure of the first? Circumstances? Difference in creativity? Laziness? Fear of failure?\n\n! To start the upward movement, you need to feel the bottom under your feet. When you decide that everything is over, this will be the beginning.\n\nThe secret is simple, the main thing is\n\nCONCENTRATION.\n\nThis principle lies in the ability to immerse oneself in the matter in which you are engaged here and now: “one task is one period of time”.\n\nThere are many training sessions on the development of concentration and increase in working capacity. I recommend the following.\n\nImagine your time in the form of piece of flavored cake. Each piece is a certain period of time on which you need to focus. One type of activity that you do for 25 minutes, without being distracted by secondary objects. Try to disconnect from external factors and devote the maximum time to solve the problem. After the specified time, take a break of five minutes and get back to work. There should be four such approaches. After two hours I advise you to take a half-hour break. This technique will not allow you to get very tired and feel the strain, especially if the five-minute breaks will be associated with physical activity. For convenience, it is recommended to set the alarm at the beginning of the experiment – in the future, your body itself will set the biological clock.\n\nWhat is the use of this practice? You will learn to concentrate on one subject for a not very long time. In the five-minute break, you will have time to relax and reflect on the work done. Your brain activates hidden reserves that will unlock the inner potential.\n\nThe rule of concentration concerns absolutely all aspects of life – from professional to personal. The inability to focus on important aspects of life due to constant stress not only leads to the loss of precious time, but also to the appearance of diseases associated with scattered attention.\n\nOne of the modern practices of NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) is associated with the feeling of “here and now”, which leads to the creation of a platform for realizing one's own importance, gaining self-confidence.\n\nFocusing on the moment gives a sense of control over the situation, not allowing the secondary to obscure the true meaning of the present.\n\nStart with the elementary. Remember how you purchased a new washing machine, how long you studied the instructions for it and loaded the wash for the first time. Do not like this example, choose any equipment – coffee maker, toaster – any item that you use daily. All your actions are brought to automatism. Try every day to consciously carry out all the manipulations on switching on and off the equipment. Make it looks like this item is in front of you for the first time.\n\nBy this analogy, we give an example. You picked up a book. You want to read it. However, extraneous sounds, flashing footage of a computer or TV, obsessive everyday thoughts do not allow you to focus on the process of reading. The reading speed slows down, and you put the book on the shelf, where it will gather dust while waiting for you to be inspired to read it.\n\nA familiar story?\n\nThe main problem of lack of concentration is, first of all, incorrectly given motivation. The purpose of reading can be any – to know the outcome of the adventure novel, preparing for the exam, studying the latest developments in the field of Finnish dialects. But at the same time, motivation should not be just an abstract goal – it should be deeply individual.\n\nThe most powerful incentives are the basic instincts – self-preservation, power and continuation of the species. The first two associated with the acquisition of a certain status – managing their own lives and the opportunity to succeed.\n\nThese incentives make a person look for a more prestigious place of work, develop skills and abilities, strive for success. All these tasks are in one way or another connected with the acquisition of new knowledge that is concentrated in textual information that everyone has access to today.\n\nFrom here we come to solving the next problem – the choice of material.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“I need literature to understand the world”, Alberto Manguel\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nHow were we taught to read at school and university? For a given topic, a list of references was proposed, on the basis of which we studied books, textbooks, and scientific publications. We did not do the selection ourselves – the education system did it for us.\n\nI will reveal a little secret. All our studies, all the lessons and lectures, which, it seemed, will not be useful to us at all in the future, are aimed to teach thinking.\n\nNot just memorizing facts, but learning how to create your own paradigm for exploring the world. Formed neural connections remain with you for life and help to master the information received from outside.\n\nIn the modern information stream, it’s not easy to select the necessary text, since a large number of publications are superficial, of poor quality, and even completely advertising.\n\nIMPORTANT RULE! Do not continue to read the book if it seems unnecessary to you. Even after reading a few dozen pages, it doesn’t always become clear, whether it’s bad material or good. But if you realize the uselessness of literature – feel free to put it aside and start the search again.\n\nImagine the situation. You came to the shop to pick up the perfume. In front of you are hundreds of jars with labels on which brand names are written. It seems, that they all entice smells, that will carry you to seashore, to streets of spring Paris, to hot desert... But there is one caveat – you don’t know a single brand, you don’t have any idea what kind of fragrance you need. So, you start to randomly sniff all the bottles in a row. Dior mingled with Chanel, woody scents with floral. Your nose has lost the ability to distinguish flavors in principle. Unsystematic choice, without knowing the features of the manufacturer and not examining information about a particular collection, you could not get what you came to the store for.\n\nThe conclusion – a careful study of the content of the source will save a lot of time, since you will not spend it on unnecessary literature.\n\nBefore you start reading, carefully review the annotation of a book or article, pay attention to the table of contents, recommendations of authors and reviewers or critics. It’s useful to read the reviews of readers on special sites, so you can evaluate the independent opinion of the audience.\n\nWhy so much time is given to the selection of material to read? Because at this stage an analysis of the potential text is already being carried out. You apply the acquired skills of the thought process to evaluate the practical benefits of the book.\n\nIn addition, knowing the usefulness of the book, you get a great incentive to learn new information. If you know exactly, what for to read the text, it ceases to be abstract and turns into a tool for obtaining a specific profit.\n\nAfter examining the outside of the book, scroll through it from beginning to end. Surely you will meet interesting moments that will hook the peripheral vision. You will want to come to these moments as quickly as possible – so you will receive another incentive to read.\n\nThis technique is called text \"anchor\". Interest in the text and the desire to keep in memory specific fragments helps to significantly improve the quality of speed reading.\n\nHere we come to the detection of the next snag – memorization.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“To be conscious that you are ignorant of the facts is a great step to knowledge” Benjamin Disraeli\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSo, the selection stage was successful – the required book is in your hands. You are fully assembled and focused on reading. However, over time, you realize that you don’t catch the essence of what you read, because you instantly forget the already processed text. You have to go back a few pages earlier to fill in the blanks. The more often you refer to the previous text, the more often there is a desire to quit.\n\nThis is called regression.\n\nThe regression refers to the return of eye movement, aimed at re-familiarization with the text. When this process is repeated, habit is formed. At the subconscious level, you will constantly return to the regression method, if you don’t learn to trust your own memory.\n\nMost often, reader justifies the regression with simple excuses – “it's okay, I will reread”, “there are too many facts”, “I just need more time”. Thanks to the techniques of this book, the vicious circle will be broken. The simulators will help to get rid of regressions, and you will acquire the skill that will be formed by repeating the exercises and will be brought to automaticity.\n\nJust imagine, how much time you spend on regressive reading! The same book can be read twice as fast if you master the skills of effective speed reading.\n\nLet us turn to the real life example.\n\nYou've come to the famous art gallery, where world masterpieces of painting are collected. Visiting time is strictly limited, so you start a cursory inspection, being in each room for ten minutes and quickly looking at the pictures. You don’t stop thoughtfully before the canvas of the eminent master, don’t enjoy the combination of colors, overflow of light and shadow. You catch only the change of shapes and colors from the corner of your eye, so when you leave the gallery, you can’t really remember a single picture of a particular author.\n\nThis is the essence of effective reading. Any text, whether a separate paragraph or chapter, requires memorization and reflection. Only in this way the material remains in your memory. It is necessary not only to assimilate, what was read, to understand the main idea of ​​the author, but also to transfer knowledge to your experience. So the material will be fixed in long-term memory.\n\nSpeed ​​reading doesn’t imply a simple acquaintance with the material in record time. It’s important to apply the principles of effective reading at each stage – reading, learning, memorization.\n\nOf course, 20 books read in a week without proper perception are much more useless than 5 books processed in a month. However, I strive to indicate a path that will lead to an increase in volume without loss of benefit.\n\nSlow reading, among other things, is closely related to the emotional coloring of the text. Each word is connected with certain experiences and associations. There is nothing negative in the method of associative memorization, however, a certain amount of effort is required to study this skill without losing time.\n\n! The comfort zone is a golden cage. Break out of it – and feel the sweetness of change and inner space.\n\nWe give an example based on this book. Possibly, that of all the reading you best remembered the story about the two designers. Why? This situation is endowed with expansion – interest in the outcome, transferring the situation to personal experience, the negative connotation of the first story and the positive one of the second. The rest of the text is impersonal. But it seems so only at first glance.\n\nUsing the techniques of concentration and selection of the desired material, any, even the most abstract, text can be translated to the rank of private, personal. Realizing that it was you, who made the choice, that you are focused on the content, you accept the text as a single canvas, where each fact has a positive coloring for you, that is, it benefits or generates interest.\n\nLIFEHACK! After reading this book and going through all the exercises and workouts listed here, set it aside for a couple of months. Do not leave the practice in any case, but! After some time turn to the theoretical basis of this work and evaluate the information that eluded you for the first time. You will see the difference!\n\nOften it happens that, precisely because of the emotional coloring of certain moments, some of the key postulates elude the reader's attention.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest”, Benjamin Franklin\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThe ability to highlight the key idea is another aspect of productive speed reading. Our brain processes information four times faster than reading words individually. Hence, as mentioned above, there arises the difficulty of remembering, and hence the selection of semantic context.\n\nReturning to the example of the art gallery, it is worth noting that after the \"galloping\" in the halls remain vague sensations. They look like this: \"I recall a picture with straight lines on a black background, and there was also a portrait and, it seems, some kind of green-blue canvas, probably a landscape.\" Are there many benefits from such memories?\n\nHowever, if the viewing speed coincides with the processing speed, then after several hours the gallery visitor will tell you, that the first hall was associated with the history of abstract art, the second was devoted to the Renaissance, and in the third he got acquainted with the development of Impressionism. With proper attention training, he also tells about the artists whose canvases were present at the exhibition.\n\nAfter reading a particular piece of text, you need to stop and think about the learned information. Try to highlight the root of the problem described, get into the author’s idea, try on the information obtained to solve your own problems.\n\nRecall, at least, the notes, you gave at university lectures. The theses stood out in separate lines and were underlined by a color marker. Transfer this technique to the reading process. Try to mentally structure the text, and you will see, how much easier the process of assimilation.\n\nConcentration is closely related to attention, which focuses on important points. If attention is scattered throughout the text, then the efficiency of concentration decreases significantly, hence the problems described above – loss of interest, poor memorization.\n\nMindfulness is practiced not only in the process of reading, but also in everyday life. Starting with the little things, we put a picture of our life, like a puzzle of mosaic pieces.\n\nImagine a brick wall in front of you. Literally ten centimeters at eye level. You see, and that is vague, only one brick or its part. Moving farther and farther away, you begin to see the whole picture. And just away from the wall for a few meters, you can appreciate the beautiful mural with the plot, the essence of which is understandable only at a distance.\n\nExactly the same thing happens with text. Individual words will not allow you to create a complete information picture. To comprehend it is possible only after passing a certain segment – a paragraph, sub-chapter or passage.\n\nFocus on the main point of reading. Close your eyes and repeat the main idea. After the nth number of manipulations done in this way, your brain will learn how to do it right in the speed reading process.\n\nMoreover! Thanks to the speed reading technique described in this book, you will learn to distribute attention in such a way, that even little details will not be left out of analysis and memory.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even when nobody else believes they can come true but you ”, Phillip Sweet\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nAmong the features of speed reading, there is one problem that is almost the most importantю It’s solving is the root of stumbling for most beginners to comprehend science of speed reading. This is articulation.\n\nArticulation is reading not with eyes, but with a throat. And it’s imparted even from school, when in the first grade students are forced to read aloud. The reason is that the text in the process of reading sounds in our head, and the muscles react reflexively to the word they see.\n\nEXERCISE! Try to stick out the tip of the tongue while reading and lightly press it with your teeth. Did you read at least a couple of lines? If yes, you will master the speed reading skills with ease!\n\nThe internal pronunciation of words has a slightly different character – the speech center is involved, but the muscles are no longer involved in the process of reading. But this technique also significantly reduces the speed of reading the text. Of course, the internal speech is more concise, curtailed, but due to this, the reading rate drops significantly.\n\nThis is connected, as studies have shown, that speaking the words, we better remember what we read, focus on the text better. Visual processing of the text is transformed in the brain into a speech code.\n\nImagine, that you need to make a report at work. The presentation was made at the last moment, and you frantically repeat the material in the lecture hall. The eyes are randomly running through the text, the meaning is not fully understood, and you constantly pronounce words in a whisper in order to remember them well. In general, this is how the process of slow reading looks like.\n\nThe speech form of text perception must be completely eliminated during the training of speed reading. It is necessary to read not according to words. You need to perceive the word as an image, capturing whole paragraphs and chapters, turning them into meaningful blocks.\n\nThat is, to improve the speed reading technique, it’s necessary to mix the accent from the audio perception of the text to the visual one, turn off the appearance of the text in speech code.\n\nThanks to specially selected techniques collected in this book, you will learn the technique of reading without using a speech apparatus. Together with the simulators aimed at developing concentration, attention and memory, fast reading will turn into an art for you, the knowledge of which can become a vocation.\n\nChapter 3. Triumphal Reading\n\nThere is such a thing – spiritual mountaineering. It was developed by the philosopher and thinker of the XIX-XX centuries, Aleister Crowley, who conducted many experiments with the mind and subconscious.\n\n The allegory is that people are divided into three types:\n\nThose, who do not know about the existence of the mountain\n\nThose, who admire the mountain\n\nThose, who climb the mountain\n\nThe beauty of this metaphor is that any activity for a person is a journey to the height of the unknown. Many people live by inertia and do not realize, how wide and full the world is around. A certain part of population of the planet enjoys the diversity of mountain peaks, studies the approaches to them, fills his life with theoretical developments. And there is a very small percentage of people who, without hesitation, begin to climb. They break down, fall, stumble on sharp ledges, but always go forward. And reach the peak.\n\nWhat percentage do you consider yourself?\n\nApproaching the mountain, you will feel some discomfort. You will come up with many reasons to step back, postpone the ascent to tomorrow, Monday, to the next month, delay for a year. You will be too lazy to start the path already planned, it will seem to you, that your excuses are very expedient. And the reason for this – fear.\n\nWe are very afraid of failure. We are very afraid of the unknown. And we are very afraid of change.\n\nIf you are reading these lines, I hasten to congratulate you – you have come to the foot of the mountain and are seriously aiming at climbing. Some obstacles have already been overcome, you have learned something new. This fact sets you apart from the average percentage.\n\n Moving on.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts”, Winston Churchill\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nLet us turn to one fascinating theory, which Malcolm Gladwell derived in his book “ Outliers: The Story of Success”, 2008. The author is a permanent employee of the New York Times, as well as the creator of such bestsellers as “ Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking”.\n\nThis work states, that genius is always accompanied by applied efforts to achieve mastery.\n\nUsing the biographies of Mozart, Bill Gates, and Bobby Fisher, Gladwell shows how important classes are to improve talent.\n\nMany consider, that talent is actually the result of combining abilities, capabilities, and involuntary gains. Are opportunities in principle subject to any regularity? As it turnes out, yes, of course.\n\nOne of the most respected professions in the world is the medical profession. And for good reason. Every medic goes a long way of learning, consisting of continuous improvement of their skills. Six years of university study, two years of internship and two years of residency. On average, about ten years is required to form a knowledgeable specialist from an inexperienced student. Is it a lot or a little?\n\nGladwell derived a formula of 10,000 hours, which is required to form the skills that distinguish a true professional. Let's translate this figure to our realities.\n\n10,000 hours are about 417 days, i.e. just over a year.\n\nSuppose that it takes 4-5 hours a day to concentrate on a particular subject and get a period of 7 years. It will take much less time dozens of times to master the speed reading technique. But to achieve phenomenal results will have to work a little.\n\nNeurologist Daniel J Levitin, Ph. D. thought, that from numerous studies, the following picture emerges: no matter what field you are talking about, it takes 10,000 hours of practice to achieve a level of mastery commensurate with the status of a world-class expert. Whoever you take – composers, basketball players, writers, skaters, pianists, chess players, inveterate criminals, and so on – this number meets with surprising regularity. Ten thousand hours – about three hours of practice a day, or twenty hours a week for ten years. This, of course, does not explain why some people benefit more than others. But so far no one has encountered a case where the highest level of skill would be achieved in less time. It seems that exactly so much time is required for the brain to assimilate all the necessary information.\n\nIt would seem that this figure doesn’t inspire. Why spend so much time on what may not be useful in life? And now look back at your past life. Did the last seven years fly quickly? I think, yes.\n\nDuring this period of time you studied at the university and began to work in the specialty, improving the knowledge gained. These seven years were not in vain. It is for this reason that you should seriously think about the fact that in the next seven years you will not regret that you started already now.\n\n10,000 hours are worth starting to transform your own life, starting at this point.\n\n! The difference between failure and success –  in relentless improvement.\n\nTwenty years ago, psychologist Anders Ericsson together with his colleagues conducted a study at the Academy of Music in Berlin. Students were divided into three groups. The first included real stars of the faculty, potential world-class soloists. In the second – those, whom teachers consider the most promising. In the third group – students, who could hardly become successful musicians, at best, they could be useful for the role of music teachers in high school. All participants were asked only one question: “How many hours did you practice from the moment you first took up the violin until today?”.\n\nThe answer revealed a surprising pattern. Provided, that all students began to play at about the same age, for example, from age of seven, they were practicing an average of 1-3 hours per day, but after a couple of years there was a difference. The best students exercised the most: by the fifteen years of training, six hours a week were spent, then eight hours, and by the time they were studying sixteen! That is, they were constantly focused on improving their skills for more than thirty hours a week. By the time, they finished their studies, they had just gathered up to 10,000 hours of classes. The baggage of average students was 8000 hours, and the future music teachers – no more than 4000.\n\nMany successful people do not realize that the beginning of their journey is a journey to the 10,000-hour mark, but you already have this advantage. Being engaged in 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening with speed reading exercises, you will feel the result after 50 hours. You will not want to stay anymore. There will be excitement.\n\nExactly with such excitement the Beatles started climbing the Olympus, playing in Hamburg five hours a night for two years! In total, they gave 270 concerts, which amounted to a total of 1,200 live performances. After that, a truly staggering success was waiting for them\n\nHamburg became for them a real race in the attainment of genius. Perseverance and unrestrained work made them world stars. How many talented musicians play in their garages? Do they really have any hits? I think, yes. But staying within the comfort zone and not improving skills, it’s hardly possible to take off to the world Olympus.\n\nHowever, on the path of becoming, there may be a feeling, that it’s enough just to mechanically reproduce practical exercises in order to achieve the desired result. Far from it.\n\nAfter you have clearly seen the positive dynamics, there is a chance to “thunder” on the so-called “okay-plateau”. This is a psychological trap, which is very easy to become a hostage.\n\nEasily going through some simulators, you begin to act on autopilot, which leads to the opposite result – degradation. The brain intentionally automates the process to reduce the load, so your attention is dulled. There is no thoughtfulness of the process.\n\nIf you follow the analogy, that the brain is a muscle, you can make out the situation with sports training.\n\nEvery day you come to the fitness center and lift your weight in 16 kilograms. At first, it’s very difficult. You barely lift the load off the floor. However, every day the muscles become stronger and get used to the load. After several months, you can easily perform the exercise and do not feel pain the next day. What happens to the muscles? They cease to grow stronger.\n\nOur brain acts the same way. Having mastered a certain skill to a certain extent, he ceases to pick up speed. Only with a constant increase in loads, with an increase in the level of complexity of the simulators, you can upgrade your skills. Have you noticed that you can easily do speed text processing exercises? Press in the area of ​​concentration and memorization.\n\nFormula 10,000 hours works only with constant monitoring and improvement. That is why I recommend each time to check your skills. Select control texts and check the level obtained every week. Highlight your strengths and weaknesses to improve the former and pull up the latter. Without the right effort, the four-hour daily practice will be wasted.\n\nOur simulators and \"readers\" (with different sizes) will help you to see the result of training, without resorting to complex calculations, they will do everything for you.\n\nThis wave recalls the story of my friend - musician. For over ten years, he has been practicing various musical styles, from classical performance to mastering rap culture. Every time he wanted to discover the nuances of a new genre, right up to polishing the material studied. And then he ran into one problem. Jazz compositions were not given to him completely.\n\nWhat did he do with his already formed baggage? Engaged in overcoming obstacles. Over and over again he began to perform jazz in a small studio. Time after time he failed, but he was not going to stop there. From the time he realized that it was becoming easier for him to play songs, but he longed for perfection.\n\nBeing engaged in jazz for eight hours seven days a week, he revealed the full potential of this music and became so involved that it made it the main line in his work. It took him about five years to master this skill. He continues his professional growth to this day.\n\nWhat is the moral of this story?\n\nEnthusiasm, multiplied by daily exercises with increasing load, really brings results.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Education comes from within; you get it by struggle and effort and thought”, Napoleon Hill\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThe postulate hides the key to success. Congenital abilities are formed over time.\n\nBooks are an exceptional source of knowledge, indispensable at any stage of development. Many celebrities say, that without inspirational books, without a constant process of self-education, they would not have become who they are today.\n\nEvery book read today is the key to a successful tomorrow!\n\nUndoubtedly, Elon Musk can rightly be considered an icon of the second decade of the XXI century. He is an innovator and revolutionary in the field of space development, the creation of alternative sources of fuel, technological systems. One of the secrets of his successful activity Musk considers the commitment to reading. Despite his busy schedule, he finds time to read every day, because it helps him move forward, be on the crest of the information wave. His favorite book, he calls the work of J. Tolkien \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Preferring the genre of fantasy and science fiction, a billionaire admits that he is a true dreamer. Such people are not afraid to look ahead and turn their dreams into reality.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, founder of the world famous Facebook social network, admits that reading is an indispensable source of inspiration and useful knowledge for him. With his busy schedule, he allocates every one to two weeks to read a new book. It seems to you that it is not enough? Do you develop projects 60 hours a week?\n\nWell-known filmmaker Steven Spielberg observed in interview, that books have a function that nothing else has, because you can be delivered with them at any time and place. On the basis of the books read, Spielberg creates truly unique worlds. All his work is the processing of impressions from the read texts. His favorite work is the novel “The Last of the Mohicans” by Fenimore Cooper. This is a director's book of the director, which he speaks of as a work for all times.\n\nOne of the top TV shows of our time – \"Game of Thrones\" – would not have seen the light if it were not for the enthusiasm of the authors of the book \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" by George Martin of historical novels. According to his confession, the inspiration for writing a series of books came to him while reading series of novels of the French writer Maurice Druon \"The Accursed Kings\".\n\nSumming up the above, I want to assure my readers that I myself am a zealous supporter of reading. Every day I make a lot of discoveries thanks to the mastered texts. First of all, the writing of this book pushed me to want to share my experience with those who seek to achieve success. I collected and refined unique speed reading techniques, exercises for improving attention, concentration and memory. I am sure that with due diligence you will surely reach the level of perception of information and the world that you could only dream of before!\n\nSuccess to you!\n\n\nChapter 4. Two Barriers\n\nBefore going directly to the practical classes, I would like to focus your attention on two cunning \"barriers\" of our world view.\n\nLet's imagine this picture. You have decided to read fast over the next few years to achieve a specific result. For example, learn Spanish using the self-instruction manual in one year. Imagine that the learning process is a track, and the goal and motivation is the fuel that allows you to realize your plans.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAs soon as we enter the launch pad, we find some discomfort that does not allow us to move on. We see a barrier in front of which the word \"laziness\" is displayed in large letters.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Laziness never arrived at the attainment of a good wish”, Miguel de Cervantes\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nPsychologists distinguish several types of laziness. The first is the mental one. Our brain is much nicer to think about simple things, rather than make a decision, make a choice.\n\nOften, such a mental trap is associated with an attempt to dodge the problem. Remember the famous Scarlett O’Hara replica “I won’t think about it today. I’ll think about it tomorrow”? In the context of the heroine’s history, this message expresses strength and wisdom, but in its everyday interpretation, its coloring is not so rosy.\n\nThere are two types of mental laziness: conditional and passive. The first is related to the fact that you intentionally avoid making a decision to engage in one or another type of activity – “I will never master it,” “I don’t have that much time,” “circumstances prevent me.” And the second is expressed in inaction after the decision is made, i.e. at the moment when the intention appeared, you do not get down to business, but mechanically continue to act ineffectively.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“If you want to conquer fear, don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.”, Dale Carnegie\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThe second type of laziness is the most common – physical laziness. Many fitness trainers broke more than one spear in an attempt to fight this barrier. There is a huge number of techniques and literature aimed at combating laziness. They all boil down to the fact, that physical laziness is closely connected with the mental one.\n\nAs a rule, when a person realizes the need to introduce sport into his life, he begins to look for excuses related to the problem of getting to the fitness center, lack of time or a tracksuit. But at the same time, laziness instantly disappears, if he suddenly received an offer to go to the lake and swim. And laziness does not limit it to wanting to do every weekend!\n\nWhat is the reason? Yes, the fact is that thought processes are essentially the product of our emotional state. I’m not talking about cases, when physical laziness is a symptom of a disease – apathy, depression, or other ailment. Physical productive activity reacts to the “must” \/ “do not” factor, because if you have to “do” sports, you do not have to swim, but the process itself brings incredible pleasure.\n\nLet us return to the study of speed reading, based on the foregoing. Brain training should not have the “must” setting; do not link this path with “binding”. Go through simulators in the most comfortable environment, practice mental practices in a pleasant environment. I specifically selected classes that are not boring, but rather entertaining. I understand perfectly well that some of the exercises described in this book will not cause enthusiasm when reading the description, but believe my experience, having begun, you cannot stop.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Talent without discipline is like an octopus on roller skates. There's plenty of movement, but you never know if it's going to be forward, backwards, or sideways”, H. Jackson Brown, Jr.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nAmong all the varieties of laziness, the most dangerous one I find is emotional laziness – the absence of any reactions to external events of life.\n\nModern psychologists derive this problem in the rank of the disease – apathy and depression as a response to a stressful habitat. Therapy and medications help to cope with emotional burnout, however, in my opinion, it is better to prevent the disease than to treat it.\n\nJust a couple of decades ago, the practice of checking potential employees for interviews with tests for logical-mathematical intelligence (IQ) became very popular. Over time, the mind factor has shifted to the area of ​​emotional readiness of candidates. Today, most employer interviews are aimed at determining the level of emotional intelligence (EQ) – a concept introduced in the same book by D. Goleman.\n\nThe conclusion suggests itself – if there is emotional intelligence, then it can be fed and even “educated”, as well as mental one. Think, how strong your emotions are, can you be aware of and control them?\n\nTo train your emotional intelligence, you need to listen to your own feelings, analyze what kind of event causes you or other sensations. Through awareness of your own emotional state, a special susceptibility to reality will come. You will feel, that you have become not only better understand yourself, but also those around you.\n\nAre you in doubt? Try the following exercise. It is called \"mirroring.\" This method is often used in the lessons of NLP, but it seems to me effective in everyday life.\n\n! Laziness paralyzes our aspirations. One big breakthrough will not allow to get ahead of those who are stubbornly and unceasingly moving towards the goal.\n\nEvery time, when you see the interlocutor's reaction or his emotion, manifested in facial expressions or posture, try to repeat it, that is, mirror it. Do not use this exercise as a manipulation, just track the change in its relationship to you. After some time, you will see that it has become warmer, more responsive. The essence of this method is as follows – what emotions would you like to mirror from you? Negative or positive? I think you know the answer yourself.\n\nIf you suddenly feel emotional devastation, if your favorite dish does not seem so tasty, if native people stopped pleasing you, if you stopped wanting something, take action, because only you are the lever of control of your own life. And will you achieve much without desires, dreams, aspirations?\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others”, Ayn Rand\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nCreative laziness. This one is close to me as no other. Psychologists say little about it, but I will tell you about it in detail.\n\nCreativity surrounds us from all sides – whether you bake a charlotte, repair a car, write a novel or draw up an annual report. By investing in any business soul, we get pleasure from the process itself. But there is a downside. It is connected with the “beginning”.\n\nOften, people around you notice, that creative people are scattered, lazy, apathetic. They can look at the monitor for days, drink coffee at night, do nothing for days. And suddenly, quite unexpectedly, in a few days they create a work in one breath.\n\nOne of my friends confessed, that when she wrote a scientific work, she always missed all imaginable and inconceivable deadlines for submitting the material. She stayed in prostration for several weeks, painfully thinking about the failed exams and expulsion from the university. But, according to her, one wonderful morning she bright and early, and, ignoring breakfast time, sat down to type the text. The work was coming out like clockwork.\n\nI don’t think, that creative laziness is laziness. If you feel, that it is difficult for you to start any business, give yourself a little rest. Catch your breath. Comprehend what you want to do. Take out the idea before you get down to it. Often creative apathy is confused with the fear of failure, but what kind of failure can wait for someone who has not even tried?\n\nA little advice from the author of this book – look for inspiration. This idea is not new, but in this section I focus on this component of the process. Read books. Watch movies. Study the biographies of famous people. Connect with successful people. It works.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“The way to gain a good reputation is to endeavor to be what you desire to appear”, Socrates\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThe next type of laziness is familiar to few, but I would still like to talk about it. It is philosophical laziness. Each of us is a little philosopher. We like to talk about life among friends, sitting on the couch, having a cup of tea in the kitchen. However, some philosophical trends are fairly dense in our life, and this does not apply to ordinary conversations and individual assessment of the environment.\n\nBuddhism, existentialism, nihilism – all these trends boil down to the denial of the meaning of the world around. The vainness of being is raised to the rank of the highest value today. Why strive for a higher ideal if life is finite? If everything around is only ashes, and we are “dust on the boots of the Universe”?\n\nIf you are lazy and you are justifying yourself with your own frailty, you are trapped.\n\nYes, our path is not endless. Of course, not every one of us will leave a mark on history. Of course, you are just a middle manager, a blogger or a primary school teacher. But doesn't your life become devalued in the context of individual perception?\n\nThe value of any human life is measured only in the quantity and quality of the desires of the person.\n\nBetween the lines this is read in any philosophical work. Even if it seems to you that in comparison with outer space, the compiled statement does not matter, remember that only a professional like you can compile it!\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence”, Confucius\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nAnd finally, laziness associated with the discrepancy between the desired and the possible. How does it differ from classical laziness, when we can take a step, but do not want to?\n\nSuppose you are sitting in a dusty, stuffy office and at lunchtime you go through the pages of a travel website. You see a beautiful white yacht, swinging on the waves near a golden villa in the sun. You sigh and lazily think that you can never live in this picture. In your head the thought sounds, \"oh if ...\".\n\nNext to you a colleague for the hundredth time trying to make a presentation on the sale of the latest equipment, which he needs to present at tomorrow's meeting. He is lazy, because he doesn’t have the slightest desire to do this work, he thinks only that the easel and paints are waiting for him at home. Tired of the hard work of everyday life, he will be drawing a snow-white yacht and a villa under the bright sun of Tuscany.\n\nOften, laziness acts as a signal, that indicates excessive immersion in disembodied dreams or that the case in which a person is engaged does not suit him at all. It is required to carefully listen to yourself and honestly answer the question about the advisability of choosing a profession, about whether it gives a chance to get what you want.\n\nDuring the passage of the simulators, as well as during the execution of the developed exercises, do not get carried away by the thought that something might not work out. From the first time even the great masters could not create a masterpiece. Only hard work will lead you to success – you will understand the simplicity and effectiveness of this statement in the learning process.\n\nAfter reading this book, you can read it again as you like – in the reverse order, selectively, diagonally, skipping already mastered. But you should definitely keep in mind the idea that anyone can handle the program.\n\nAfter getting acquainted with the first part of this chapter, I recommend you to sort out your own feelings and understand what type of “barrier” hinders the realization of life goals. Perhaps this is a series of obstacles, overcoming which your well-being depends on? As soon as you decide on the type of laziness, it is not difficult to overcome it, because, as you know, you always need to know your enemy.\n\n! Laziness generates boredom. Laziness is healed by dedication. Dive into what inspires you and feel the freedom of flight!\n\nTo eliminate the barrier of laziness, I suggest using the visualization method. Many dismiss this method due to the (often contrived) lack of imagination, inability to mentally reproduce images, but I developed a system that will allow anyone to cope with this task.\n\nClose your eyes and mentally imagine the road and any obstacle in your path with the type of laziness that is unique to you.\n\nIf you belong to the category of visuals, i.e. people who find it easier to perceive visual material, be it text or illustrations, detail the appearance of the barrier. What could it be? A wall, a small fence, a tree across the road? The color, texture of wood or metal, frayed and roughness. Visualize surrounding objects: a sandy or asphalt road, markings and stones, whether it is lined with trees or framed by a field. Paints should be bright, colorful. The smallest detail – the clouds, the font that says the word \"laziness\" – will help make the picture more realistic.\n\nTo another type of people – audial, more susceptible to the sound reproduction of information – I advise you to create a picture melody. Try to mentally reproduce the sound that surrounds you, to hear the sound of the wind, the rustle of leaves. Imagine, that the word \"laziness\" as if you are whispered by an inner voice. Under the influence of sounds, the blurry picture in your head will become brighter.\n\nFor some people, tactile sensations are more important – they are called kinesthetic. If you belong to this category, mentally feel the obstacle – will there be a warm tree under your fingers or a cold one to become, whether the paint on the post has been erased. Try to touch the font that issued the name of the obstacle. Touching will help to recreate the image of the obstacle to moving further the barrier.\n\nCreating an image can take more than one hour. Invest in the appearance of the \"lazy\" barrier all the negative that it causes you, all the negative emotions generated by the idea that laziness slows down the movement forward.\n\nWhen the image of the barrier is finally ready, proceed to eliminate it. Break and destroy it in any way, as long as the obstacle melts without a trace, and an endless level road leading to success stretches before you. Feel all the joy of the feeling of free space, appreciate how easy it is to take a step, if there are no barriers in front of you.\n\nThis exercise can be done more than once. Repeat it until laziness is gone completely and every time it feels like it is coming back.\n\nSo, the first barrier is removed, what is the next barrier?\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude”, Colin Powell\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nHabit is second nature. Habits are both beneficial and harmful. The first must be acquired, the second – to get rid of.\n\nSome of our habits are “embedded”. They were formed over millennia and \"registered\" in the collective unconscious, the study of which were engaged in S. Freud and C. Jung.\n\nINTERESTING FACT! Interesting observations were described in the film “Wakinglife” where the hero talks about an experiment, the essence of which is aimed at identifying a certain collective mind. A group of people was given a crossword puzzle specially compiled for the subjects, which they had to solve. After they were given a crossword puzzle for solving, which was released a day ago. The results were amazing – the percentage of unraveled words in the second case was higher by 20%! It turns out that the answer, which already exists in the universe, is much easier to get.\n\nA single mind allows you to transmit information of behavior on an intuitive level, i.e. Some habits are already programmed in the subcortical consciousness. We perform those or actions simply by inertia.\n\nThere are habits, that are formed at the subconscious level in the period of growing up. We look at the parents, and the algorithm of actions is laid at the automatic level. Often, we ourselves choose habits in adolescence, wondering little about whether they are useful or not. Only realizing that, for example, the habit of being late brings discomfort, we try to get rid of it.\n\nAnd here we come to the most problematic type of habits – acquired by artificial means.\n\nHabit is the most bizarre barrier: in the open position, it acts as a positive pattern of action, and in the closed position – a negative one.\n\nHarmful habits greatly complicate our lives – laziness, procrastination, the abuse of pernicious addictions, the manifestation of negative uncontrollable emotions – lead to destructive consequences. Everyone chooses their own good habits – someone doesn’t have enough morning runs, someone is trying to introduce a healthy diet, at the moment you are trying to get into the habit of speed reading.\n\nIt is rather difficult to get rid of stenciled actions, as well as to master them at the level of automatism. It is necessary the habit becomes an inseparable part of the daily ritual. Imagine that speed reading is your favorite pet, which needs its own place (time), food (exercise on simulators), care (practice).\n\nAt one time, Maxwell Maltz made a revolutionary discovery in the sensational book Psycho-Cybernetics, published in 1960, which made 21 days to form a habit. Unfortunately, this statement is erroneous, which is what the author himself says, but it has taken the form of ultimate truth.\n\nThe author, on the basis of the conducted research, derived a formula that states that the habit is developed in at least 21 days. Minimum.\n\nIn London the experiment was conducted, during which different groups of people were given quite harmless tasks, for example, to eat a piece of fruit for lunch, to run fifteen minutes after dinner. For some groups, the load was more difficult – fifty squats in the morning or an hour walk after breakfast. The study was conducted within 84 days and led to the following results.\n\nElementary routine actions became an established habit for at least 66 days, while participants in the second group dragged out the process for almost a year. The more complex the installation, the longer the adaptation period is required for assimilation.\n\nDuring the experiment another important factor was identified. Bringing to the automatism of any action moves in a hopping way. The initial stage, filled with the enthusiasm of the subjects, passed quite easily. After a certain period of time (it is individual for each person) simple habits entrenched in the subconscious, but the complex ones began to disappear from the daily ritual.\n\nThree weeks to form a multistage, time-consuming habit is not enough. Starting to learn from this book, plan no less than 50-60 days. Perseverance and conscious practice will help you get through the period of habituation. Constantly keep in your mind that setting in the form of motivation that you have developed for yourself at the beginning of preparation.\n\nTo identify your typical habits, analyze one day from start to finish. Celebrate every action, starting with a morning visit in the bathroom until the ritual of preparing for bed. What habits do you perform on an automatic level, and which ones require effort? Which of the habits benefits and which, on the contrary, is an obstacle? What habits would you like to put into daily practice?\n\nStart small – choose one action that is not labor, for example, drink a glass of water every day before breakfast. Assess how often you forget to reproduce this operation, after what period of time a glass of water became a constant for your paradigm. On the calendar, mark the days when you drank a glass of water and skip the days when you forgot to do it. Did it happen that over time the number of empty cells became less and less?\n\nAccording to the same scheme, proceed to the study of speed reading. Devote one hour in the morning and two hours in the evening to exercises, simulators, techniques, reading texts. Keep a diary where you will celebrate successes and achievements, where you can briefly describe how the barrier automatically disappeared at your will.\n\nPersonally, I developed good habits to rebuild my whole life or correct things that did not suit me, using simple rules:\n\nSmall changes always lead to astounding results. When you start to change something, the brain quickly adapts and learns. Minor changes in the daily routine can result in a real breakthrough in mastering new techniques, such as speed reading.\n\nStart changing habits with enthusiasm! Optimism, interest, goal is the best motivation to change something!\n\nTrust yourself. Sometimes I noticed that I did not undertake the development of new habits, because I am afraid that nothing will come of me, that I will break, give up what I have begun. This is not faith in yourself – this is trust. The trust lies in the fact that you give yourself a chance to show your best qualities and not to allow negative traits to become on the way to achieving the goal.\n\nPermanent energy supply. I got help from my work and healthy sleep. Successes at work charge me with an excellent mood, and sound sleep contributes to a cheerful mood. Now it has become fashionable to talk about lack of sleep as an achievement, evidence of success. I disagree with that. Mental work requires rest for the brain, so make yourself a habit of getting enough sleep every day!\n\nBe perspicacious. Always think in advance about the difficulties you will face. As long as you do not speak each of them, they will remain abstract and more frightening. For example, before the lessons on speed reading, you can be afraid of many reasons, factors, conditions. But as soon as you say to yourself: “I may not have enough time, at the end of the day I feel tired”, as soon as the brain begins to look for a way out, to think about solving the problem. And obstacles are eliminated much easier.\n\nWatch for yourself. As soon as there is a desire to return to the old bad habits, assess your condition, listen to yourself, pay attention to the contradictions within you and take the right position.\n\nSet short-term tasks. For example, during the week I will not eat sweets, or for a whole month I will run in the morning. Be sure to bring the matter to the end and feel the state of success. This effect will work as a dope when you move on to more complex and lengthy tasks.\n\nDo not make exceptions. Do not think that one day, which became an exception, will not be able to go into the rule. Do not look for excuses. Only, if your condition is connected with a violation of health, postpone training – otherwise do not violate the systematic nature of training.\n\nMake a habit your prize, reward. It is much easier to think that, subject to certain rules, we received a precious reward. And what if you turn the process into the desired prize? Think of the habit, as a way to take care of yourself, as an opportunity to please yourself. Attitude to new tasks will change immediately – they will cease to be a tedious routine.\n\nDo not tackle multiple cases at once. Practice first one habit, not five in a crowd. Then the effectiveness of the process will be one hundred percent.\n\nRespect your failures. Think of them not as a reason to surrender, but as lessons that you learn from life! Those who do not give up after a defeat, are more likely to achieve something better. Only the one who does nothing is not mistaken – remember this postulate and think about it when you stumble. Get up and move on.\n\nDo not be afraid to ask for support. Let the one who is with you rejoice at your successes and sympathize if something went wrong. Speak your results to those you trust, who is close to you in spirit!\n\nRemember that changing habits is a tool for self-discovery. In the process you will learn a lot about yourself – your abilities, your strengths and weaknesses. In a couple of months of changes, you can learn about yourself something that you haven’t guessed over the years.\n\nRecall the analogy with the mountain and the three types of people. In the context of my paradigm of world outlook, this is a conscious avoidance of difficulties at the expense of justifying laziness of any type. If we imagine the process of teaching speed reading as climbing a mountain, then yes, I affirm that this path is not easy, but everyone can master it.\n\nIf you determine exactly what type of laziness is your personal barrier and introduce three-hour daily exercises into the habit, then you will not stop at the start, you will not think in a negative way, \"can I?\" Moreover, having overcome these obstacles, you will certainly be able to put into circulation a lot of new good habits. Having studied a certain algorithm and applying it in practice once. You will be able to use it as a personalized instruction, no matter what it touches – healthy eating, sports, training, etc.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Good luck happens to people who work hard for it. Sometimes people just fall into the honey pot, but I've consistently strived to create whatever good fortune I can get in my life - and consistently strive just as hard not to screw it up once I have it!”, Patrick Duffy\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPart II. From Theory to Entertaining Practice\n\nI would like to devote this section of my book to methods, that helped me to learn speed reading at one time. Of course, I am aware of the fact that you would like to immediately begin training with simulators, but based on my own experience I can say that classes without a prepared base are only 40% effective.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe answer to this question lies in one fascinating story.\n\nOnce I had the opportunity to talk with a fitness coach, who was engaged in the method of development on a unique system. The system consisted in the fact, that before the start of training she told her charges about the structure of the body. Just imagine, that all your life you, without thinking, walked, sat, ran, having no idea what the skeleton consists of, how muscles work, how blood flows through the vessels. Realizing and mentally reproducing the inner workings of the body, many of the clients of my acquaintance admitted, that they began to reproduce movements with more meaningfulness, as if learning from the simplest skills anew – to take a step, to move a hand.\n\nBy the same analogy, I want to reveal to you the mechanics of your brain and consciousness, eliminate those stop signals, that our mind gives in the process of speed reading training. By understanding the system of perception better, you will go through the simulators from the third part of the book with a high efficiency ratio.\n\nCarefully selected techniques, collected in chapters on the field of vision, concentration, attention, memory and ergonomics, will reveal new facets of consciousness. Most of the methods and tools, described below, may be familiar to you, however, some of them have substantially reworked.\n\nYou will be able to use the obtained results not only when learning speed reading, but also in everyday life – you will learn to perceive the flow of visual and auditory information in a different way, being at home, at work or on vacation. Thanks to the exercises, you will be able to better control your emotions, develop intuition and memory, and will be able to expand the analytical horizon of the brain.\n\nYou will never know, what you can do, if you don't try!\n\n\nChapter 4. Seven Golden Pillars of Speed reading\n\nAny theory is based on generalized rules and principles. Over time, the technique is enriched by discoveries made by researchers, who have dedicated more than one year to a particular kind of activity. Opening any guide for speed reading, you will find seven basic settings, that allow you to master this technique. I will give this list in a modified form, because I see the point in processing the key points.\n\nNumber one. Reading without regressions\n\nAs you remember, regression means returning to the already read text, since the majority of readers don’t have time to master and remember the text.\n\nSpeed reading teaches reading information at the same speed as its processing. My task in this part of the book is to teach my audience to rely first of all on their own memory, avoiding the doubt that they will not be able to cope with a volume of several pages!\n\nWithout confidence in your own capabilities, moving forward is impossible. The active development of memory and concentration will allow to perceive the text as a process \"here and now\" without need to return to the past.\n\nRegression accompanies us not only in the process of slow, thoughtless reading. We encounter it every day – we regret for words, that we didn’t say, we are experiencing moments of the past. Present your life as a book – would you like to constantly return to the written lines? How important is it for you to focus on the present, without losing time on the past events?\n\nEvery time, feeling like re-reading the text again, imagine that life has given you only one chance – the opportunity to find out this information at this very moment. You will see how valuable each piece of essay, article, paragraph will be.\n\nNumber two. Integrated read algorithm\n\nTo me, this formulation seems too complicated. Many modern non-fiction publications present information overly intricate, trying to arouse the confidence of the reader. But the wording can be significantly simplified.\n\nIn essence, an algorithm is a set of operations, that we perform daily, often without even thinking about it. By inertia, we perform familiar rituals. For example, in order to brew a mug of aromatic tea you need:\n\n1) Boil water; 2) Get the tea box; 3) Open the tea box; 4) Put a couple of spoons of tea in a mug; 4) Pour boiling water on tea; 5) Stir with a spoon.\n\nDo you think about this algorithm, when going to work or to the university, especially in the early morning? I think, no. The same applies to speed reading. If you master the scheme for which thoughtful reading is carried out, this process will gradually enter into constant practice, you will simply not be able to read differently!\n\nThe speed reading integration scheme is as follows:\n\nTitle → Author → Source → Main content → Facts → Features → Novelty\n\nIf the first five blocks are specific facts about a book or an article – the name of the text, authorship, year and place of publication, as well as key points and information, that the author reports, then the sixth and seventh paragraphs suggest an individual study of the material. The peculiarities of the text are understood as controversial statements, the possibility of synthetic analysis, the way the addressee perceives it. Novelty means “freshness” of what is being reported, how useful it is for the reader, the possibility of applying the data in practice.\n\nThis scheme distinguishes speed reading from slow reading. Indiscriminate reading of the literature doesn’t allow the text to be analyzed, while purposeful division into seven blocks leads to effective structuring.\n\n! A strong desire to teach is 50% of success.\n\nWhile reading the text, imagine, that you put the material on the shelves, correlating the information received by the semantic sections. This will allow you to avoid randomness of thoughts in the process of reading, and will relieve factors distracting the mind.\n\nAt first, it may seem to you, that constantly holding a seven-point scheme is too difficult, but the habit will form over time. You will unconsciously perceive the text as an ordered construction.\n\nFamiliar philologists told me about, how to study art works at the university.\n\nFirst the historical epoch, in which the novel or story was created is studied.\n\nThen goes the exploration of the philosophical currents, that are the result of historical events.\n\nThe next stage is acquaintance with the biography of the author, who adheres to certain philosophical convictions.\n\nAnd only after working through this information, students begin to analyze the work itself as a product of the environment and the author's vision.\n\nThis scheme of analysis of any text seems to me the most productive, since it involves understanding and awareness of all the components of the material – from the base to the individual perception.\n\nThe pinnacle of reading a book or an article is your opinion about reading and applying the knowledge gained in practice.\n\nNumber three. Selection of the main semantic meaning. Text dominant\n\nThis was discussed in the previous part of the book, but I repeat once again – the ability to select the semantic grain from the general information material is the main principle of effective reading.\n\nAccording to some critics, out of 100% scientific or technical material, only 25% of the volume has practical importance. This principle is not so actively applied to fiction, but I can say with confidence, that some authors bring to the essence of the work for hardly hundreds of pages!\n\nFor example, you see the following text:\n\nBased on media reports, it was concluded that a single-story structure made of super-combustible material with a woody texture, under the influence of high temperatures, was destroyed due to illegal actions of persons under the age of minority.\n\nIs it convenient for perception? What is the message that carries the text? Yes, everything is simple:\n\nThe house burnt down.\n\nThis fact is the semantic dominant of the message. Eliminating unnecessary information, you learn analytics and significantly save time on understanding what you read. Among other things, capacious facts remain in your memory for a long period.\n\nNumber four. Reading without articulation\n\nThe main enemy of speed reading is the internal pronunciation of the text by words. In the previous chapter I tried to explain the essence of this problem. Here I want to emphasize, that you can get rid of a bad habit by rebuilding the mechanics of reading itself.\n\nSpeaking the text with lip movement? Feel free to take a pencil in your teeth to control this process.\n\nCan you feel the text in your head? Try to create a different reading rhythm. If you are an audial (better perceive audio information), get a metronome or a ticking clock; if kinesthetic is closer to you (tactile perception of the surrounding world), then tap the rhythm with a finger or a pencil. Of course, for all these purposes, we have wonderful trainers, that will help get rid of pronunciation.\n\nRemember, that speaking the words while reading, you are on the way to understanding the text erect another obstacle, thereby depriving the brain of the possibility of high-quality processing of the material.\n\nMore specifically, we will dwell on this component in a separate chapter.\n\nNumber five. Vertical reading\n\nTry to read the text, while tracking the process of eye movement. Noticed, how many times your pupils made a shuttle run from the beginning to the end of the line?\n\nThis type of reading reminds me of typing on an old typewriter – the slider moves from left to right, and then with a deft movement of the hand is thrown back to the left side of the page. Is such typing effective? I don’t think so.\n\nThis problem is associated with a small field of view, which means fixing a small portion of the text with a glance. Traditional reading includes only two or three words for one fixation, while fast reading allows you to cover entire paragraphs and pages.\n\n\nWhen reading text vertically, the gaze moves from top to bottom, accommodating whole phrases and sentences in sight. In addition to increasing the speed of reading, the level of understanding of the material increases, and there are visual-figurative representations.\n\nNumber six. Development of attention and memory\n\nThe effectiveness of speed reading rests on the backs of these two pillars. If the previous rules are more connected with the practical development of the methodology, then this is with the mental restructuring of thinking.\n\nLearning to concentrate on a particular type of activity, without being distracted by external objects, is attentive to the process being carried out and remembering useful information – three important factors, that help to achieve success. Having learned to focus on the text and constantly improving properties, you can get rid of regressive reading and easily highlight the dominant of the material under study. The green point simulator will help in this.\n\nNumber seven. Daily practice\n\nAlthough this promise is last on the list, I can say, that it plays a crucial role. Do you remember the theory of 10,000 hours? To strive for this figure is necessary every day. This applies not only to the exercises, but also to the reading itself.\n\nIt’s advisable to read two newspapers, one magazine or 50-100 pages of the book daily. Otherwise, the sense of all the training will be zero.\n\nFor example, you decided to give yourself a rest for one day. Our brain is a very cunning and resourceful “comrade”, who is able to find many loopholes in order to rest and not overwork! It can decide, that one day for respite is too little and will look for new reasons – “tomorrow is too intense day”, “tomorrow is Sunday”, “on Friday I want to relax with friends”, etc. etc. And if he manages to turn this scam, you will give up speed reading for many months ...\n\nDon’t give yourself relief, because after you go through a certain stage, it will be much easier to study. The brain will get stronger and will require more and more new food in the form of texts and exercises. The trick called \"tomorrow\" can discard you from the implementation of plans and the realization of the dream for many years! Start now!\n\n! Looking back, you will regret not starting today.\n\nFinally, I want you to constantly keep in your head the answer to the question, for what. What am I reading for? Why do I do speed reading? Why do I use this or that practice? Meaningful action is a guarantee of success, a pledge that you will not give up what you started half way.\n\nWhy are you reading this book?\n\n(You will find the answer on the last page, but without going all the way, you will never understand it!)\n\n\nChapter 5. Your Enemy – Articulation!\n\nDo you know how the scandalous work of the mid-20th century begins? “Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta”- this is exactly how Nabokov, using the description of the articulation process, describes the tenderness that causes the name of the beloved in the main character.\n\nTry to pronounce any word. Feel how your tongue moves? As with the pronunciation of the letter “s”, the tip of the tongue rests on the teeth, and the sound “m” makes the lips close and open? That is how speech is born. By letters, syllables we are taught to read in school.\n\nThe mental process of reading is very similar to the examples I described. Ocular receptors are closely related to the speech apparatus. Just imagine this way: here the look fixes the word, here it seeps through the eye shell and slides into the speech center, bypassing the moment of reflection, reproduced with the help of the larynx, the image of the word begins to form in the consciousness. The word as a set of characters and signs is recognized, deciphered by thinking, after which the reading and, not so often, memorization is realized.\n\nIf we present all our actions as factory operations, then calculate how many high-grade products you can make with such irrational use of your capabilities?\n\nStudying the issue of articulation, I was confronted with the opinion of physiologists, with which I fundamentally disagree. I will cite here an excerpt from one, most popular, work: “The visual perception of a word ends with its recognition, that is correlation with a certain meaning. For this to do it’s necessary to recreate the auditory-motor image of the graphic word, since in the long-term memory the words are stored primarily as auditory-motor complexes endowed with a certain meaning. Visual perception is therefore always accompanied by pronouncing the perceived; while reading to himself, it’s carried out in internal speech and is of a collapsed character”.\n\nLet me decrypt that for you. The printed or written word enters the long-term memory only by speaking. The reader in the process of reading involves such brain centers as the visual, the transformer from the visual to the sound, the auditory and the logical. Of course, thanks to X-ray photography, minor articulation processes were detected, even for those who read relatively quickly.\n\nHowever, I am sure that it is possible to suppress this process, to reduce it to practically the minimum. The stumbling block, as I understood in the process of passing the methods, is internal speaking, which significantly slows down the process of speed reading. An internal monologue, not only at the moment of reading, but also in everyday life, prevents the assimilation of information, like the way it interferes with listening to a television set by a loud radio.\n\nAt its core, articulation is the following chain of actions: reading information → information passes through speech centers of the brain → information is perceived by the brain → speech apparatus (larynx, lips, language) reproduces sounds → understanding and memorizing information is performed. Thus, the text enters the brain without understanding in the speech center and is absorbed only through the speech apparatus.\n\nThe inefficiency of this method of reading, I realized on the third page of the test book.\n\nArticulation is the number one enemy when learning to read speed because it slows down the process, making it automatically ineffective and putting the following steps at risk: regression, concentration, analysis, memorization. Therein lies the danger – loss of control over the ability to combine speed and assimilation of information. As mentioned above, the more slow the process is, the lower the quality of its understanding.\n\nGetting rid of internal pronunciation can reduce the emotional aspect of text perception. Of course, fiction is the least affected, but every day we are confronted with text files of completely different directions.\n\nBy emotionality I mean not only one or another emotional coloring of a single word or phrase (a pleasant sensation or not), but also a moment of recognition and comparison with the facts and data already in the baggage of memory. Speed ​​reading helps to “tamp down” the moment of analysis into the reading process. But more on that – later.\n\nVisual perception of information requires training. Do this experiment. Open any text, take a look at it and immediately close your eyes. With absolute certainty, it can be said, that one or two words were recognized. Not read, but it is instantly recognized. It is on this technique that articulation elimination exercises are built.\n\nAcquiring fast reading skills, I usually recommend choosing the following strategies:\n\nOverview reading. While reading, the necessary part of the text is quickly detected\n\nIn-depth reading. Reading the desired text passage.\n\nLet's look closely at each of them.\n\nThe method, proposed above, is aimed at finding and recognizing information. At the level of the first strategy, the moment of recognizing information occurs without any pronunciation. For example, among the bulk of scientific work, you need to highlight key findings. At this stage, the reader is most likely looking for recognizable patterns – individual words, phrases in bold or italic.\n\nThe second strategy involves thoughtful reading related to speech activity. This is primarily due to texts that are replete with new terms and concepts. Stumbling over every unfamiliar word, you should only linger slightly on it, note in your memory and continue reading at the same pace.\n\nREMEMBER! It is almost impossible to completely get rid of internal pronunciation, but you can suppress it to the maximum, so that it does not distract the brain to articulation activity.\n\nIn training to get rid of articulation, it’s necessary to combine two layers of strategies, i.e. apply the so-called dynamic reading mode. From the preview part go to in-depth reading with the understanding of the facts and data. During the preliminary assessment of the text, you can already get an idea about it and install some templates, after which attentive reading will take place in a smoother mode.\n\nBy fast reading, I don’t mean imply the haste of the process. Reflection not excluded at the speedy assimilation of information. That’s why I recommend using the technique of preliminary study.\n\nAfter the preparatory work, you can proceed directly to those exercises that neutralize at the limiting level of the action of the speech-motor center in the brain.\n\nThere are quite a lot of techniques, aimed at getting rid of articulation. I collected the most useful ones:\n\nTry to read the text and at the same time mentally list the numbers or pronounce the poem, you know by heart. The rhythm of the text being reproduced to oneself has a key importance, since a certain rhythm of reading is produced. So you can clearly separate the functions of the visual apparatus from the functions of speech. Didn’t work the first time? Try again and again.\n\nFind your rhythm and tap it with a finger or some object while reading. This technique almost completely blocks the speech center. This technique is most effective, since attention from the speech center is shifted to the motor one. You can replace the tap of the rhythm with the help of the \"readers\", that I have developed, which are located in the third part of the book. Thanks to a certain rhythm of the presentation of the text, the information flow can be varied at different speeds.\n\nRead any text with a pencil, pen, brush (if you are a writer, an office worker or an artist), a spoon or fork (if you are a cook), etc. If you absolutely don’t like foreign objects in your mouth, hold the tip of your tongue between your teeth or press your lips, the main thing is that the articulation apparatus is not used during reading. As soon as you feel, that the speech playback has returned without proper effort, start over.\n\nRead with maximum speed, without thinking about the text. Imagine, that you are being chased by the worst image of nightmares and rush through the text, not paying attention to the meaning. In fact, articulation is thus a monster for a quick reading technique.\n\nRead the text vertically. Mentally draw a line in the middle of the page and get down, as if by a tightrope, downwards. Before this, try to cover the entire canvas of the text as a whole, as if photographing it. After a pause of less than 15 seconds, begin the reading process.\n\nAnother technique appeared in my arsenal quite by accident. Turn on the TV, radio or your favorite set list at an acceptable volume and read the text silently. Audible perception will help suppress the desire to pronounce the text to yourself.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning, that these techniques are not mastered in a few hours of training. For example, reading without speech reproduction with a subject in the mouth is obtained only at the twentieth hour of training. Therefore, my most significant recommendation is the systematic nature of the classes. Spend this process for an hour every day – half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening.\n\nAn important factor in the process of weaning off internal speaking is energy mood, by which I understand the totality of the emotional and physical states of the reader.\n\nExercise should be in the most comfortable environment in a relaxed state. In the chapter on concentration, I will tell you about techniques, that contribute to achieving concentration and inner peace. Smooth breathing, comfortable posture, the brain, freed from the daily hassle to a large extent contribute to the passage of training.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n“The more that you read, the more things you will know.

Area of View: Defocus\n\nImagine a huge canvas of text. For an example, I’ll give Jack Kerouac's sensational novel ‘On the Road’. He wrote the text of his first creation on the wallpaper without paragraphing. One sentence could be about a meter long without any punctuation marks.\n\nHow comfortable would it be for you to read such a voluminous material, not divided into certain blocks?\n\nEssentially speed reading is the process of “running through a glance” throughout the text with the assimilation of the required piece of information. For a slow-reading person ‘sheet”, created by an American author, is an unreadable, extremely complex work, but for the reader, who is familiar with the quick reading technique it’s an exciting journey into the world of beatniks of the post-war period.\n\nHigh-speed reading consists in non-stop reading from the beginning of the text to its end. The key role here is played by the smooth transition of sight without braking on each line. The area of ​​this technology rests in the framework of the field of view, on the methods of expansion, which focuses this chapter.\n\nAs you remember, the difficulty is that a glance at a slow reading is fixed on one line one or even more times. This is due to the fact, that during the process peripheral vision isn’t involved, allowing you to see the entire text.\n\nWe are accustomed to receive the main share of information through direct vision, but lateral vision is equally important for the development of the environment.\n\nHow well is your peripheral vision developed? I propose to conduct an experiment.\n\nLook straight. Pull the closed palm forward and slowly take away it from sight. Once the palm is out of sight, slowly move it so, that it’s barely visible. Open your palm. How clearly do you see each of five fingers?\n\nYour brain isn’t able to perceive information from the side visual field, which is why you miss a considerable part of the information environment. For mastering of speed reading the development of lateral vision plays very significant role. Direct look doesn’t allow to cover the text entirely, because of which there are slowing down the pace of reading fixation.\n\nIn this chapter I propose you several techniques aimed at expanding the field of view by training lateral vision, defocused gaze, photo reading.\n\nI will begin with the simplest techniques, the performance of which can be done even by those, who have never come across such techniques.\n\nThe development of peripheral vision. It is carried out with the help of the following exercises, for which you must sit in a comfortable chair or on a comfortable chair opposite an empty wall. The look needs to be focused on one point on the center.\n\nFirst exercise. Without moving your sight from a fixed point, try to stretch your peripheral vision and see the objects around you. Focus on side objects. Most likely, in the first minutes you will not see anything, but gradually objects will begin to acquire clearer contours.\n\nSecond exercise. On A4 sheets, draw letters, numbers or any other objects, as long, as they are bright and colorful. Stir the sheets and lay them in front of you. After that, focus the straight look on the point and take one sheet from the pile. Move the image on the outstretched hand to the lateral view and try to see the drawing as clearly as possible. Gradually increase the deflection angle to seventy to eighty degrees, which is the limit for the external field of view.\n\nThird exercise. The procedure is identical to the previous one, but the images must be reduced by half, then three times and so on to the smallest images, that you can distinguish. By reducing the figure, peripheral vision will learn to recognize even the most finely printed text.\n\nThis exercise is recommended to perform 15-20 minutes a day, so as not to overstrain the optic nerves. If you feel a strong tension, I advise you to blink quickly for a few minutes to avoid a headache.\n\nTo expand the field of view, you can use simulators, that develop this skill from the third part of the book.\n\nThe technique as a whole is not aimed at the ability to read with peripheral vision, however, this skill is very useful in teaching speed reading, contributes to an increase in the amount of information absorbed and involves more brain areas.\n\nThe human brain has one feature – it captures in the field of view the object about which a person is thinking at the moment. I will give a simple example. You are walking along the road and are concentrated only on the point that lies directly in front of you – the head is down; you are looking at the asphalt. However, the world around you offers a huge flow of information – moving vehicles, people passing by, representatives of flora and fauna, urban objects. All this eludes the field of vision, since the gaze is concentrated on only one subject.\n\nMoving the focus helps to cover a much larger range of information. Due to the conscious distribution of focus, you will become more attentive. Being in public places, at work or at events, you will be able to capture the smallest details of the behavioral model of certain people in your environment, their external appearance, surrounding space, color and texture of objects.\n\nThe following exercise is recommended for moving the focus.\n\n\nPosition this drawing of circles at a distance of 15-29 cm from the eye level and, without letting the circle out of the field of view, try to see the tip of your nose. You will notice, how each of the images has been bifurcated. Remember the defocus technique and try playing it again. Train until you can do it without any effort.\n\nThe next step is to combine the circles into one. With a defocused look try to connect your neighbors from forked circles into one circle. The effect will be amazing – the image will receive the volume. Hold this picture for as long, as you can.\n\nThe final stage of the exercise is to keep your look in the defocused state on the side objects. With fixed pupils move the inner sight from the center circle to the left. Return to the original state and go to the right circle. All this time the central object must be in sight. At first glance, the task seems impracticable, but after several days (or weeks) of training, you can freely move the view from object to object.\n\nThis training is aimed at acquiring two additional points of view, contributing to a more extensive perception of objects, including text materials. The skill fixed to automatism won’t only help to master speed reading, but also strengthen lateral vision.\n\nA defocused look is an interesting practice, applicable not only in the field of teaching speed reading, but also in the field of psychology and even esoteric. The shamans asserted that, owning this ability, one can see the true world of things, psychologists say, that the technique helps to withstand even the most intense gaze of the opponent. With the help of a defocused look you can easily watch a movie in a foreign language and, focusing on the picture, read the subtitles. At first glance, it may seem, that only a few can master this skill, but this is far from the case.\n\nDefocusing is a kind of attempt to deceive the brain due to the fact, that you remove the sharpness from all objects, that fall into the area of ​​your vision. You can match this process with the camera settings, when the focus moves from the foreground to the back. If all the objects in the lens are double, then the sharpness is distributed. Sometimes this effect happens, when you think for a long time, looking at one point. Harm to the eyesight doesn’t carry out defocusing training, especially, if you take breaks every 10–15 minutes during classes.\n\nBefore I talk about how to properly defocus the view, I want to warn you about the most common mistakes.\n\nExcessive effort. It is not necessary to fix intensely time after time the idea, that you need to remove the sharpness of objects – this can lead to the opposite effect. A look will cling to each object. Obsession with the idea instead of meditative relaxation will not allow to deceive the brain, which deliberately makes you strain your eyes.\n\nPseudo-defocused view, or otherwise \"empty.\" Just looking at one point it’s impossible to defocus the view. Objects become blurry purely automatically. Images become muddy, with subtle outlines, but this is completely different from objects devoid of sharpness. In a state of empty glance you can stay indefinitely, but exactly until the moment, when the objects begin to move. Distinguishing between these states is quite simple – a true, defocused look requires concentration and eye strain.\n\nBefore doing directly defocusing exercises, it is recommended to perform a series of preparatory exercises.\n\nTake a relaxed pose. Close your eyes. Make several rotational movements – first in one direction, then in the other, so you will relieve tension from the eye muscles and nerves.\n\nWatch a few commercials or movies with subtitles, trying to focus your attention on the picture and on the text. At first, it will be difficult to concentrate on two objects at once, but little by little the eyes will get used to the rapid frame change.\n\nSet a mirror in front of you and look into your own reflection. The muscles of the face should be relaxed, the look calm, without emotional. Imagine that the look passes through the glass, through its surface. Little by little, the reflection will begin to blur, lose its shape. The face seems blurred and as if distant.\n\nATTENTION! If you have vision problems – hyperopia or nearsightedness – then you need to train no more than 5 minutes in a row and take 30-second breaks.\n\nTo master the defocus technique and increase the field of view, I recommend the following method.\n\nExpose hands with raised index fingers. Using a direct look, spread your arms in different directions until they are no longer visible. In this case, the fingers should always remain within the field of view. After that, bring your hands together and repeat the whole process just as slowly. Then, join your index fingers together so, that one overlaps the other. Now raise one hand up and the other down, fixing the gaze in front of you. Reaching the point, when the fingers are not visible, bring your hands together, placing your fingers cross to the cross and continue to spread your arms now diagonally. Holding a direct look, with your fingers on opened hands, twist clockwise first, and then – against. With peripheral vision, follow the movement of your fingers with a defocused look.\n\nThe technique of a dispersed view appeared long before developments in the field of speed reading. It is most vividly described in the works of Carlos Castaneda, a staunch magical practitioner, who inherited the knowledge and wisdom of Indian shamans.\n\n! Desire is a thousand possibilities; unwillingness is a thousand reasons.\n\nThe exercise, allowing to disperse the view, is as follows.\n\nSurely, each of the readers has a favorite place in the city or outside, from where a wonderful view of the urban or natural landscape opens up. When you come to a favorite shop or a fallen tree, sit in the most comfortable position and focus your straight look on a point just above the horizon. As a rule, we focus on the contemplation of an object, or switch it from one object to another – bird, house, cloud, tree and back. This technique involves complete comfort and dispersed attention. Take a break from specific objects and defocus your gaze. Cover the whole picture, but try to keep the smallest detail in view. The look should be like as if go into the picture of the world around you, but don’t miss a single movement around yourself. Do not hurry. Breathe exactly. When you enter the desired state, you will see, how the landscape has transformed around you. It’s possible, that during the exercise, you will feel some strain. In this case, it’s worth “letting go” of the defocusing, let your eyes rest and start the exercise again. Over time, the eyes get used to it, and the heaviness in the head will disappear.\n\nAnother way to expand the field of view is the state of photo focus. This condition is immersion in complete relaxation of the body and brain. The main purpose of this technique is to deconcentrate the view, to soften in such a way, as not to focus on individual words, but to cover the entire text.\n\nThe photo focus technique is aimed at enhancing communication between the visual apparatus and the brain. The information gathered from the text doesn’t enter the analytical section of consciousness, but directly into the unconscious region. The sight doesn’t focus on individual words and phrases, but covers the entire page. In the framework of this technique, this view is called \"soft intent.\"\n\nWith a photo focus, visual impulses entering the brain are imprinted at an unconscious level and are revealed to a fuller extent. Each new page of the text leads to a neurological reaction – the brain “recognizes” the patterns, projecting them from later onto the logical level of conscious thinking.\n\nWith the help of photo focus, the page can be read in a second, and the whole medium-sized book in just 5 minutes! The unconventional method is that the material passes the stage of conscious reflection, but is impressed on the mental plane, thereby remaining for a long time in the sub-cortex of the subconscious.\n\nThe technology is rather difficult to master, since the text during photo reading may seem fuzzy, as if blurred. You seem to be moving away from the text and see its duplicate focused, but moved to the side, look. The uniqueness of the technique allows you to feel the clarity of each word in the aggregate, to plunge into the depth of each page.\n\nTo practice photo focus, you can use the following exercise. It is necessary to sit comfortably, slightly moving away from the table. On the edge of which lies an open book (newspaper, magazine, etc.). Place any object on the floor under the book. Focus your look on the lower edge of the book so, that the subject also comes into view. Slowly move the book so, that it covers the subject. Seeing the book in sight, look at the boundaries between the pages. The text that pops up between them is a duplicate of pages that is imprinted on an unconscious level.\n\nNow try to move the book to your eyes, without letting go of your eyes. As soon as the look passes through the center of the book, you will be able to fix the double edge of the text. At first it will be quite difficult to see a duplicate, if you want to achieve a result. Training should be repeated daily.\n\nExpanded view, which is carried out photo reading, makes the participation of conscious processes minimal and increases the percentage of information processing by the subconscious layer. Thus, information is imprinted at a deeper level.\n\nTry another method, if this one seemed too complicated. Open the book and focus your look right in the center – between the pages. Extend the field of view until all four corners are in your vision. Try to spread your eyes so, that all the lines are as clear as possible. Now move your attention to spaces and text fields. Mentally connect four corners of the book diagonally. When performing this exercise, you will clearly see, that the image of the pages is imprinted on the sub-cortex of consciousness.\n\nA relaxed look while doing photo reading helps balance the visual system, engages the visual muscles, strengthening them. Listen carefully to your own feelings and don’t give your eyes an undue strain.\n\nHere I want to pause and note, that photo reading is only one of many speed reading techniques. I present it in a descriptive order only as part of a practice, based on absolute eclecticism and interactivity, when the reader chooses the method, that suits him best. This can be compared with the achievement of catharsis in various religious cultures – prayer, reading sutras, meditation. Trying different methods, listen to internal sensations, study, how your body responds to certain processes and changes.\n\nIn the “Field of view” section, I would like to make a digression related to both the defocusing technique and the photo reading.\n\nEven as part of a quick reading, you can change the pace of learning. Speed is adjusted depending on how familiar the text is and recognizable, simple or complex.\n\nThe reading process is most rapid in the event, that the text has already been read; if you already assume, what is said in the following paragraphs; if you intuitively mark the usefulness of the information in some passages.\n\nThe speed can be somewhat reduced, if the information is difficult or informational for you; if the text needs to be studied and thought over in detail; if the text is rather complex in terms of an oversupply of terms, foreign words, etc.\n\nIn either case, speed reading involves a continuous process. Lowering or increasing the pace, in no case you should not stop! Drop the old habits associated with regression and a constant return to the incomprehensible. In the process of mastering information, the brain independently interprets and “digests” an incomprehensible meaning or leaves you with a field for study. Any text is fraught with answers to all the questions we are interested in, just sometimes we don’t have enough patience to get to the finish line.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“I'm not well-read, but when I read, I read well”, Kurt Cobain\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\n\nChapter 7. Concentrate!\n\nOur mind is an amazing thing. It may be, as our most faithful ally in the search for solutions to a multitude of problems, analysis of information, the birth of ideas, and to turn its forces against us. Together with brilliant thoughts, we are often visited by obsessive ideas, anxieties, which can confuse and become a real obstacle to the achievement of a goal.\n\nI have often noticed, how people of nature genius missed the chance, because their mind gave rise to imaginary phobias, doubts, fears. This happens most often due to excessive (in a negative sense) mental alertness. The uncontrollable mind becomes a source of real anxiety.\n\nImagine situation, in which two mice are looking for a path in a maze. One of them is rushing about chaotically, embraced by fear from corner to corner, and the second freezes for a few seconds, before each turn, trying to focus on previous experience, and not on basic instincts. Which one will get to the finish line first?\n\nThe inability to control impulses leads to a state of chaos, uncertainty. If you don’t feed the mind, don’t learn to keep your own emotions and feelings in balance, the reverse process occurs – the mind becomes uncontrollable.\n\nWhile reading, as I said above, it’s important to be able to focus on the process itself. If your thoughts are far away from the text, the point in getting information disappears – you don’t remember, understand, cannot analyze.\n\nFrom these conclusions follows such a facet of our so amazing thinking, which is more often manifested in everyday life, like absent-mindedness.\n\nIn life, we are constantly found scattered people. Once I decided to calculate, how many times a day people around ask me, what time is it, and after hearing the answer, they again ask and clarify. As a rule, at that moment, when the interlocutor asks the question again, he already knows the answer. At least five times. Per day.\n\nI’m once suffered a similar lack of coherence. I noticed how, reading a book or a newspaper, I was distracted only for a second and realized, that I had lost the place, where I stopped and didn’t even know, what I was reading about! I had to take up the text anew, and so on in a circle – until I realized the senselessness of the process.\n\nThe specificity of our attention resembles a spoon in which an egg lies. Remember such a competition from children's competitions – who will run to the finish with a whole egg? One wrong move – and valuable cargo is broken on the floor or the ground. In an outstretched hand, you constantly feel the tension, the egg balances and tries to slip. One has only to look away from the spoon, as the hand loses its balance. It is necessary to divert attention only for a split second, as the victory has already been lost.\n\nThe same thing happens while reading. Text is the egg, that you hold on a spoonful of concentration. If you are not focused on the object (book or article), you will never get to the finish line. Noticing, how the egg begins to slide off the spoon, you should immediately return it to its original position. I think, the metaphor is quite transparent.\n\nThe most difficult thing is to catch the slipping attention in time. As a rule, we notice the moment, when we have lost vigilance, just being distracted by our own thoughts. That is why it’s so important to warn this moment to prevent the loss of control over attention. Even before the second slipping, you should know, that the egg is about to be lost.\n\nFor training attention concentration a lot of techniques was created. Among them, I single out several directions, which I will discuss below. I consider meditation the most effective practice, since the peculiarities of the eastern mentality seem to me to be the best evidence of this.\n\nI don’t pretend (in any way!) the role of a practicing yoga, who has attained enlightenment, I simply use those tools, that I find effective. Focusing on the moment “here and now”, the ability to control the flow of thoughts, to hold in attention many objects at once, the ability to separate the most important from the secondary is all hidden behind the cover of ancient practices.\n\nNot only Oriental wise men used the lessons of meditation, one way or another the meditative state extends to any states, in which our brain abilities open up – the ability to turn to the subconscious, the ability to contemplate with a defocused view and much more.\n\nTherefore, I want to make a separate emphasis on the fact, that by meditation in this book I mean entering into a certain state, I don’t advocate conversion to another faith.\n\nAll receptors concentrated in our head (as parts of the body) are interconnected – the optic nerves with the voice, the thinking nerves with the respiratory, etc. Connection of the last couple was the starting point for the development of a whole set of breathing exercises aimed at maintaining attention. By controlling each breath and exhale, it’s possible to significantly exacerbate the internal concentration, make it invulnerable to excess flows of thoughts.\n\nPractitioners advise with each breath to “check” their concentration, sharpen it as soon as you feel that it “slips off”.\n\nThat’s, it turns out, that you don’t follow the breath in fragments and only when it’s distracted, but continuously and permanently check it, warning you of attempts to distract.\n\nThis is one of the best ways to strengthen concentration during practice, which helps me a lot, and I highly recommend it to you.\n\nIf you feel, that this process causes too much stress, relax with each breath, let go of this state, and with each breath, continue to resume a moment of concentration.\n\nA more simplified approach, like training to the one described above, is to check attention not with every breath, but only from time to time. This approach is practiced by the teacher of meditation in the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, Gen Lamrimpa, saying, that concentration can be “tired”, if you test it with each breath. Therefore, he proposes to do this, when you consider it necessary (for example, while reading) to inspect your attention while inhaling and “correct” it, if necessary.\n\nConduct experiments – try to go from a temporary concentration to a constant, and vice versa. The main thing is to feel the result, but not to get an overwork situation. Smooth, quiet breathing will help to keep attention under control, therefore, it’s better to practice this method in a relaxed state, which is the basis for all meditation techniques.\n\nThe process of thinking creates a picture of our world throughout life, not stopping for a minute. In addition to the picture of the world, human thoughts create an image of himself in his own consciousness, based not only on the unconscious and subconscious levels, but also involving the consciousness in the process, which transforms the information flows received from outside. The background thinking process takes place in the form of a mental dialogue and at times fetters us, holding us within the framework of the formed ideas.\n\nConstant, continuous streams of consciousness resembling water, that flows smoothly from a tap if it is faulty. Even if you substitute the palm of your hand, it isn’t possible to restrain this flow, as it’s impossible to imagine, that all the water on earth suddenly ends at once.\n\nAn adult is trying to influence his surroundings, change his life and other people, but he doesn’t succeed. “Why?” – the question arises – “what am I doing wrong?”. Constantly poured by streams of mental water, objects slip into the sewer, but we can do nothing about it. And the blame for the installation, created and fixed by our internal dialogue.\n\nInternal dialogue is a concept from psychology, that describes the process of continuous internal communication of a person with himself. One of the elements, that provides the dialogues of consciousness inside the head is reflection – a continuous assessment of the subject's own state and experience, both the past and the present, and the future. The internal dialogue is the result of the presence of several subjects of communication within the consciousness – the person and his second self. The internal dialogue is explained as the interaction of different ego states, for example, a free man and a busy man, a lazy man and a responsible person. Roles are distributed in such a way, that exciting problems and momentary situations are constantly scrolling in your head.\n\n! Remember, that only the fear of failure is on your way to fulfilling a dream.\n\nThis term is often found and used in esoteric teachings. I didn’t find much of this information in the speed reading works, although I consider it very important to learn how to “block” the tap – an internal dialogue.\n\nI first encountered this definition in the books of Carlos Castaneda. According to the teachings of Castaneda, the internal dialogue is a tool with which a person creates and fixes his own picture of the world, which makes him immune or weakly receptive to new information. Stopping the internal dialogue is one of the main tasks, the achievement of which is necessary for changing the picture of the world and gaining knowledge.\n\n“When a warrior learns to stop the internal dialogue, everything becomes possible; the most far-fetched schemes become attainable. Whenever the internal dialogue stops, the world collapses, and extraordinary facets of ourselves surface, as though they had been kept heavily guarded by our words. You are like you are, because you tell yourself that you are that way. You are too heavy and self-important. Let go! Turn off your internal dialogue and let something in you flow out and expand. That something is your perception, but don’t try to figure out what I mean. Just let the whispering of the nagual guide you. The way to stop talking to ourselves is to use exactly the same method used to teach us to talk to ourselves; we were taught compulsively and unwaveringly, and this is the way we must stop it: compulsively and unwaveringly. Once inner silence is attained, everything is possible. Silent knowledge is nothing but direct contact with intent”.\n\nContinuous dialogue in consciousness leads to many problems, encountered during the study of speed reading – articulation, poor attention and concentration, inability to analyze the material. I put together all the negative consequences of the flow of thoughts, the elimination of which should be directed by the attention of the person, who decided to take control of his own thoughts:\n\ninability to focus on the moment or process;\n\ncontinuous mental noise in the head, drowning out other informational signals from the outside;\n\nincessant reflection, i.e. evaluation of our actions, thoughts and events of our life;\n\nstate of stress due to the constant return to problems and issues;\n\ninconsistency of consciousness – an internal dispute related to decisions, choice and assessment of the correctness of actions\n\ninability to make sensible decisions due to \"white noise\", mental disturbances;\n\nunreasonable anxiety, suspiciousness, suggestibility, which often leads to insomnia;\n\nstiffness in the physical and mental sense;\n\none-sided flat perception of the world, inability to expand the boundaries of consciousness, which in fact leads to limited thinking;\n\ndrowsiness or a condition close to it;\n\ndifficulty in exercises related to meditation, concentration, visualization, etc .;\n\ninability to control one’s own thoughts;\n\nliving life in automatic mode, by inertia, not realizing itself in the current moment;\n\noften arising far-fetched aggression or guilt.\n\nSometimes it seems, that thoughts overwhelm us, they are uncontrollable –  but far from it! You can stop the internal dialogue by engaging in relevant practices, that are suitable for those, who have a developed imagination, visualization ability, and seeks to control their own thoughts. Control thoughts so, that they couldn’t control us.\n\nRecreation of thoughts. To practice this method is necessary in solitude and tranquility. Perfect time is the evening before bedtime. Try to relax the body as much as possible, from the tips of the toes to the nape. Visualize any shape – it can be a rotating cube, a pyramid, a water ball, a glowing box, a red cone, etc. Focus fully on this imagination, hold it in your mind, don’t allow the focus on internal dialogue.\n\nScore. The easiest way to practice at any time, only on the condition, that nothing distracts you and does not interfere. Start counting from one to a thousand in the reverse order. Count as much as you can, focusing only on numbers.\n\nTracking. Watch your own thoughts, feelings, reactions of sensations to the surrounding reality in order to take complete control over yourself and your mind.\n\nContemplation. Recreation of mental images of imaginary or real cities, countries, natural phenomena, animals or plants in their minds with the help of imagination, their thoughtful gazing and focus on them.\n\nI have placed separate techniques on internal dialogue in the “Exercises” section. I consider constant and persistent training to be the most important condition for getting rid of internal dialogue. Many of the practices can be trained outside the home, some under full control.\n\nHaving gained control of your own thoughts, you will feel incredible relief. You will hear and see the world in a completely new way, reveal its full potential. As soon as you turn off the tap with an endless stream of thoughts, you will feel control over your own life, which you can control yourself, rather than a reflexively recurring and renewing argument within you.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success”, Swami Sivananda\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nAs I said earlier, this book was created not only as a textbook on speed reading, but also as an opportunity to improve the quality of the brain, which will allow us to develop the ability to process information coming to us from various fields. As part of the course, I propose to master meditative techniques related to visualization and concentration.\n\nAttention concentration is closely related to willpower, which, according to Buddhists, is concentrated in the eyebrow (Ajna). By concentration means “long focusing”. Many yoga textbooks focus on long-term visualization.\n\nResearches have shown, that focusing one unit of attention on the initial question favorably affects the effective use of the remaining units during the reading. In other words, by concentrating on the beginning of the process, it’s possible to improve both the ability to analyze and to memorize, and then apply the information obtained. Focus is key.\n\nFor example, when you drive a car, you are fully focused on the road, so as not to get into an accident. You don’t look at the hood or pedals, you are constantly watching the roadway, signs and traffic lights. By the same analogy you should read, fully immersed in the process itself.\n\nFor effective reading, the ideal subject for focusing is the space behind and above the crown. I'll tell you about this technique in more detail.\n\nIt’s difficult for many people to achieve an ideal attitude for reading, especially, when they are at work or thinking of disturbing things. While reading in the office, phone calls are constantly distracting, you have to hurry with the delivery of projects and reports, so as not to be late for the deadline, and a headache arises from thoughts about home problems and a broken car. What attention will be directed if the brain turned into a continuous tangled tangle? On third-party thoughts. On a little rubbish and fuss about. Reading will be a truly painful exercise.\n\nThe ideal state for reading is the opposite of the above. It is a state of flux, when you are completely absorbed by the book or article before you.\n\nFor highly intelligent readers, the point of attention is clearly defined and located just behind and above the crown. It is possible to achieve such a position of a concentrated area, even without having the skills of fast reading or quick concentration.\n\n\nUsing simulators for concentration, you will significantly advance in mastering this skill.\n\nOne of the most effective techniques for training concentrated attention and control over it is the “Apple” technique. The technique allows you to enter two states at once – a relaxed and simultaneously concentrated state of the body and mind.\n\nMany people note a fair amount of benefits obtained after using the “Apple” technique. First of all, they learned to achieve a state of rest, without losing focus on the moment. In addition, the technique helps to calm the brain and automatically focus attention on the desired subject. The result is instant improvement in both acquired and acquired skills.\n\nPerform the exercise as follows:\n\nImagine apple. Mentally place it in your palm. Squeeze lightly. Feel its weight, color, peel and smell. Now transfer it to your other hand and catch it. Throw apple from hand to hand.\n\nNow catch the apple with your hand and imagine, how you put it on top of your head. Touch this place with a cautious movement. Imagine a apple lying in the back of the head. Mentally replay all his qualities. At this time, you need to give up and relax your shoulders. You can imagine that this is the apple with magical properties, and it will remain at the place where you put it as much as you want.\n\nClose your eyes and mentally hold the apple on your head. Note the changes in physical and mental condition during this procedure. You will feel relaxed and focused. Let your eyes remain closed, but the inner vision will open and the part where the apple is located will become visible.\n\nSave this sensation, fix it in consciousness and slowly open your eyes. You can start reading, while maintaining a sense of peace and maximum concentration inside.\n\nExperimenting with this technique, you can more easily perceive and assimilate the readable material, and you will do it at the highest possible speed. You will develop the ability to focus on textual information, while the process of reading itself will take place in a relaxed state.\n\nAt first, before each reading session, you will consciously place the apple on your head. Then it will start to happen automatically, and as soon as you take the reading material in hand, some of the attention will automatically take its place.\n\nSuch a state of physical relaxation and mental concentration is also useful for more everyday forms of activity. At its core, it’s similar to meditative practices, when a person is immersed in self-awareness \"here and now.\" Such a state is the most productive for the work of any kind of activity – work, leisure, learning.\n\nDon’t confuse a relaxed state with elementary drowsiness. Relaxation is purely external. In fact, you are focusing the brain on a specific object with a sense of inner peace. You have access to all the internal resources of the body. You fully feel yourself in space.\n\nTechnique \"Apple\" manifested in various forms throughout the history of mankind, ranging from Buddhist practice and ending with the teachings of the ancient Indians. Each of them contributes to fixing attention in place just above and behind the head.\n\nExperiment with this technique. If the image of a apple doesn’t inspire you, try focusing your attention on the right place with the help of other objects. You can put on the top of the bird, a cap of snow, a funny hat. For greater persuasiveness, look in the mirror and mentally draw the desired object, make sure that it is in the right place.\n\nThere is another way, very similar to the previous one. Imagine, that while reading you are standing outside the body and looking at your nape. During this process, notice the change in your feelings.\n\nINTERESTING! The occipital region has been considered a sacred place on the body in many cultures. So, the inhabitants of Bali believe, that through this place the energy of the Universe and the cosmos comes to us. Quite possibly, this is due to the fact that when a child is born, its spring is open – hence the mythical assumptions about the openness of our crown to higher forces.\n\nWatching yourself, you’ll find an interesting thing. Having fixed your attention with one of these techniques, you open your eyes and suddenly the material becomes controllable. The look will defocus itself. The field of view expands. In this state, you are able to perceive visually much more information, cover large fragments of text.\n\nAchieving this state of the brain is the goal of this practice. You aren’t trying to keep the mandarin on the back of your head throughout the entire reading.\n\nFixing a point of attention is like putting a key peg at the base of an entire wooden structure. One small element holds all other parts in unity. By analogy with this comparison, one focused point of attention collects and directs all other threads to the reading task. Fixing it only once, you can no longer worry. When you pass through the door, don’t take it with you. Then comes the moment of moving forward, which is carried out with full awareness of the activity.\n\nThe “Apple” technique consists of two stages: setting a goal and moving to a perfect state with a fixed point of attention located at the back of the head. Also during the exercise, you need to remember, that purposeful reading is effective reading. Having defined the purpose of the process, you’ll gain control over the meaning of what is happening.\n\nDuring training, be sure to note all the changes, that occur in your physical and mental states. Full absorption of the book in a relaxed state – this is the effect, that you should get.\n\nOpen any page of any book, you have not had time to read. Read two or three paragraphs without putting the apple in the right place. After that, evaluate the reading. Then put the apple on top again, using the method described above, and read a few more paragraphs. Compare the new result with the previous one.\n\nDuring the experiment, you may be squeezed by the feeling, that you are doing something unusual, which is strange and somewhat frightening. Without seeing the result, it’s very difficult to carry out the process. If you feel this fear, the effect may not be achieved as a whole. Try to do the exercise, trusting this technique. Many of those, who have mastered this practice, show an expansion of the field of vision, that the eyes began to move smoothly, the ability to read phrases or whole sentences and even paragraphs at a glance appeared.\n\nSimilar in performance is the exercise \"Green Dot\". Contemplation of the green dot is one of the main exercises for learning fast reading techniques. The perception of the green dot occurs through immersion in a special state. The method of observation develops concentration of attention, trains willpower by obtaining the necessary installations. With this training you’ll learn to better focus on any process.\n\nThe method of working with the green dot is as follows:\n\nSit up straight and relax your body.\n\nPlace the text below at a distance of 30-35 centimeters from eye level.\n\nDo not read the text framing the green dot.\n\nNext, perform eye gymnastics: the head is fixed straight, and the eyes move down, up, left, right, into the distance, near.\n\nLook at the green dot for 10 minutes (later you can increase it up to two hours, but no more).\n\nThird-party thoughts need to be driven away (use the skill to stop the internal dialogue).\n\nConcentrate full attention on the green dot. All your thoughts are directed only at her.\n\nExercise should be performed in a calm, even light.\n\nIt is very convenient to perform it on our simulator.\n\nThe whole body is relaxed – the legs touch the floor. Your hands are free to lie on the table. Your back is even, breathing is even and calm. The look should be slightly dispersed, eyelids slightly covered.\n\nDuring the contemplation of the dot no text can be read in any case!\n\nAt the expiration of the given time for observation, close your eyes and go to sleep. The illusion of continuing contemplation of the green dot should be the last visual impression of the past day.\n\nExercise is performed for 3 months daily without interruption.\n\nContemplating the green dot, consciousness goes through several stages. As the concentrated calmness increases, the micro movements of the eyes become smooth, soft, almost imperceptible. It is becoming easier for you to keep your attention on the dot, to focus your thoughts only on it.\n\n! Without regular classes there is no result.\n\nHowever, be careful – if you start falling asleep due to complete relaxation, the dot will begin to “float” in different directions: left-right, up-down, approach you or move away from you. This shouldn’t bother you. You should keep the state of “calm concentration” and return the green dot to the place, gradually bring yourself to the state of habitual wakefulness. The task becomes easy and simple – to look at the green dot is not difficult, eyes without any effort in stillness stop at it, all extraneous thoughts disappear. The vision of the green dot becomes clear and bright. Achieve a special clarity of consciousness, which is the main goal of the exercise.\n\nWhen you master this technique (usually it takes one or two weeks), start to set the next task – the gradual expansion of the volume of perception. You should strive to see, along with the green dot, all large passages of the text – right and left, above and below. Then expand the field of view in width and horizontally. Then strive to see the entire line of text from the center of the page horizontally. Then increase the amount of perception – you should see 2-3 lines of text up and down with a green dot – it means not to read the text, but only to feel its presence, to see the image of the text.\n\nReading is always closely related to eye movement. In this exercise making such a movement is strictly prohibited. The whole period of contemplation of the green dot your view is fixed only on the dot. Seeing, contemplating a text isn’t the same as reading a text. It means to try to discern the outlines of the words, phrases, and sentences surrounding the green dot with side vision. Gradually you see more and more fragments of text.\n\nThe ultimate goal is as follows. For 10 minutes you freely contemplate the green dot, without being distracted by extraneous thoughts. After you suddenly see the whole page at the same time with the green dot in the center. This does not last long, just a few moments, but this is enough to get a new experience, contributing to the expansion of the field of view.\n\n\nI am completely calm. I am absolutely calm. A quick reading gives me joy, a feeling of lightness. Rise. I do not get tired, and my health improves every day. It's easy for me to learn to read. Being engaged, I remain free, fresh. Now I try, as vividly as possible, to imagine what the text is about. I read the text of any difficulty only once. I always use the first rule of speed reading – to read without regressions. Eyes run free and easy only forward. I can read this. I will read like this forever. I read quickly. I constantly remember seven blocks of the integral reading algorithm. I see the visual image of the algorithm clearly. Reading the text, I freely lay out its content in blocks of the algorithm. I drop all the excess. The new reading program acts by itself, out of habit. I will read like this forever. I read quickly. I always see in the text its main semantic meaning – the dominant. Clearly see it. It is displayed on the screen, convex, bright, and contrast. I can always write it in my own words, in the language of my own thoughts. I read quickly. I have no articulation. I remember the rhythm of its suppression. He does not speak. I will always remember him. I read faster and faster. I feel that every day my vision becomes sharper, focused, strong.\n\n\n\n\nMy field of view is constantly expanding. Every day I see the whole page better and better, I see the whole text at once, clearly, distinctly. My view is free, calm, clear. Eyes easily and freely glide over the text only vertically, from top to bottom, in the center of the page. I can read in fifteen seconds, in seven seconds, in one second. I see the text as on the screen. Clearly see the whole page at once. I try, as vividly as possible, to imagine what is at stake. I feel strong, young, healthy. The nervous system, my whole body is gaining energy, calm, endurance, strength. My dream is deep, strong. I read amazingly fast. I am always attentive, focused. Outside thoughts do not bother. My attention is subordinate to me. I constantly train my attention. I have a great memory. My memory is improving every day. The necessary is remembered by itself, without any effort and is displayed as on the screen – fully and accurately. I read quickly. I enjoy the quick reading technique. I read freely, easily, with tranquility. I am completely calm. I am absolutely calm. Fast reading gives me joy, a feeling of lightness, lift. I do not get tired, and my health improves every day. I read quickly. I coded new programs and reading codes in my brain, in my mind. I will always read quickly.\n\n\nOne of the amazing people who inspired me to study with my thinking at one time was Hannes Lindemann, who was not only a German doctor, but also a navigator and sailor who swam alone (!) on an inflatable boat the Atlantic Ocean for 72 days. In his experience he showed, how important is to work with yourself in order to achieve the goal. In his book on autogenic training he gives a lot of interesting concentration exercises, from which I chose one, in my opinion, the most effective practices, which are just below.\n\nThe most fascinating method, drawn from this author, is a technique related to a person's ideas about himself, about how he would like to see himself. Kind of a projection of “successful you in the future” to “you in today's day.”\n\nThere is no secret, that thoughts are material. Freedom is gained only those, who is able to control their thoughts. With the help of a certain direction of thought, it’s possible not only to get quite material benefits, but even “rebuild your body”. Imagine such a situation. You fell ill and went to a doctor, who prescribed you a number of drugs and told to have a bed rest. Lying in bed, you are immersed in a state of self-pity. You moan and consider yourself the most miserable and sickest person on earth. It seems to you, that the disease will never leave you, despite the pile of pills on the bedside table. Tell me frankly, are you determined to recover?\n\nAs it turned out, human health is the inevitable consequence of his attitude to the world. Many doctors say, that positive-minded people are less prone to illness, but even if they catch a virus or a cold, they are cured many times faster than those, who are afflicted with fear, doubt and self-pity. In other words, the blues can become worse than the flu.\n\nThis conclusion applies to all spheres of human life. People, suffering from illusory self-suggestion, rarely go beyond their own capabilities, and don’t even use them. While working on yourself, you should give yourself the setting – “I am what I think of myself” and try to rethink your aspirations and self-assessment. You just begin to read fast and feel, that some exercises are not obtained? Give yourself the installation – “I and only I am able to pass this training”!\n\nThe ability to enter a relaxed state during the day helps not only to improve one’s well-being, but also to concentrate on the surrounding objects and events. If your body and mind are stretched to the limit, if you feel that your mind is enslaved, you will not be able to reach an open level of relationship with the world and others, you will constantly feel a certain tension and negative.\n\nWithout a share of internal stress, of course, it’s difficult to build a working day. But have you noticed that almost every year this tension grows and increases? Remember your last completely relaxed day. Was that a long time ago? Could you feel complete peace of mind?\n\nRecently, an increasing number of people are trying to avoid internal stress and use \"artificial\" means of immersion in a relaxed state. As a rule, this is due to the emergence of bad habits. But how long do these “methods” last?\n\nConstant overstrain leads to the manifestation of external signs, that are associated with chronic diseases, a constant feeling of irritation and nervous exhaustion.\n\nOur brain is a very fine organization – the muscles are connected with the centers of the brain, which are responsible for our mental state, so muscle overstrain often leads to enslavement on an emotional level. So, we can say, that our body is a kind of sensor, that tells us about the negative currents of our thinking.\n\nIn this state, it’s simply impossible to master new techniques.\n\nThe ability to relax refers to natural processes, but for some people it’s a stumbling block. We constantly need to move somewhere, and remind athletes, who run along the road, unable to stop. The lack of emotional release simply kills us.\n\nBeing in constant stress, a person loses the ability to concentrate attention, so I would like to focus on techniques, that allow to relax the body, since it has a direct connection with our brain activity. In addition to pleasant walks, leisurely conversations, reading, contemplation, there are trainings, that allow you to relax at the expense of mental attitudes.\n\nTry using some of the techniques, instead of referring to relaxing preparations. During the day, interrupt a work or any other process with the following wording:\n\n\"Work gives me true joy.\"\n\n\"I study easily. I like to learn the unknown.\"\n\n\"I can easily keep thoughts in my head.\"\n\n\"I see the main point. I can easily find it.\"\n\nSometimes people don’t see value in such inner and mental beliefs, but they do work! Our consciousness is what we are. Internal contradictions, increased motivation, concentration of attention – all this is into us. What bothers you, you can suppress at the expense of installations, and the reverse process is possible, no less. Removing locks and opening new borders can be “generated” using simple formulas:\n\n\"My line of thought is clear.\"\n\n\"I can handle. I can do that. I can achieve my goal.”\n\n“I am concentrated. I work with great attention.”\n\n“At first I will work, but then I can reward myself with a well-deserved rest.”\n\n\"My thoughts flow smoothly and freely.\"\n\n\"Ideas themselves come to my mind.\"\n\n\"I read \/ write \/ draw \/ consider freely.\"\n\nEach of these formulations will make you stop and exhale, take a breath. However, I would like to offer you a method, which, in my opinion, is the most effective for achieving a relaxed state.\n\nTraining on the sensation of gravity by Lindemann.\n\nThe purpose of this technique is to achieve a relaxed state of the muscles by feeling heavy. It’s the basis for immersion in concentrated relaxation, which facilitates directional concentration. Your attention should be fully focused on the sensations.\n\nThe exercise begins with the formulation of the problem – “my hand is heavy”. In order to make the result more complete, one should start with the hand, that you use more often, that is, the right-handed one focuses on the right hand, the left-handed – on the left.\n\nThought appears in your head: “My right \/ left arm is heavy.” Visualize, intensely reproduce this thought to yourself. Don’t utter the phrase out loud. If you start speaking it out even in a whisper, you’ll see, how much the sound of your own voice prevents you.\n\nGet yourself together as much as possible, and let this thought capture your consciousness. Of course, superfluous thoughts will start to appear in your head, the stream of consciousness from memories, experiences will start to penetrate little by little into consciousness. Do not relax. With a willful effort, get your thoughts back on track and focus as much as possible on the feeling of heaviness in your hand. If you notice, that the thoughts \"flew away\" in the wrong direction, start the exercise from the very beginning. If you cannot concentrate, try to keep your breathing in order. However, if this method didn’t work, and you feel inner impatience and arousal, transfer the exercise to another time.\n\nThe formula of gravity must be silently pronounced at least six times. After you concentrate on this thought, proceed to the next step. Now add the phrase “I am completely calm \/ calm” to the mental reproduction. After it, resume the cycle with the phrase \"My hand is heavy.\"\n\nTime, that may be required to fully feel the heaviness in the hand, for each individual. As a rule, six fold reproduction of the formula takes about half a minute, but these limits can be extended. In the first week of training, the gravity formula is pronounced to itself about 18 times. Combined with the “I'm completely calm” insert, it will take you about two minutes.\n\nRemember, that if during the exercise you feel discomfort – fatigue, headache – stop training and have a rest. Overvoltage does not help you achieve the desired result.\n\nDid you feel, that thought eludes you? Speak the phrase a little faster, so that the consciousness does not have time to switch to external objects.\n\nTrack your condition. In conducting this experiment, Lindemann noted, that some participants felt the weight of their hands already at the first lesson, and for some it took almost a month. Choose your pace and do not throw an exercise if success doesn’t come to you immediately.\n\nIf it’s difficult for you to achieve a result, try to endow the experiment with sensual experiences – imagine, that you are carrying a heavy bag of groceries in your hand or pulling a bulky suitcase. Try for five seconds to squeeze your hand to the body. Following these, as a rule, the sensation of gravity comes immediately. You can also use the following auxiliary exercise. Put both forearms on your knees, then slowly tighten your palms to your thighs. Do this before the onset of a critical point, at which the weight of your own hand will automatically appear.\n\nNow try to feel the heaviness in both hands. Do it not at the first stage of training, because initially it’s important to learn to concentrate on a specific part of the body.\n\nYou can try to cause a feeling of heaviness in both hands at once. However, this makes it difficult for beginners to mentally fix on a certain part of the body, which is especially important at the beginning of training.\n\nIn general, the exercise cycle is as follows:\n\n\"I am completely calm.\"\n\n“My hand is very heavy, very heavy, heavy” – 2 times.\n\n\"I am completely calm.\"\n\n“My hand is very heavy, very heavy, heavy” – 2 times.\n\n\"I am completely calm.\"\n\n“My hand is very heavy, very heavy, heavy” – 2 times.\n\n\"I am completely calm.\"\n\n“My hand is very heavy, very heavy, heavy” – 2 times.\n\n“My body is relaxed. I feel pleasantly relaxed. I am still very calm”\n\nIn order to get out of this state, you need to bring the tension in your hand to the maximum, take a deep breath and open your eyes.\n\nNow analyze your condition. Do you feel lightness in your body? Do you feel relaxed?\n\nThis exercise precedes the methodology, which is even more associated with meditative immersion in a relaxed concentration. Go to the next step.\n\nTraining on the feeling of warmth according to Lindemann\n\nAfter a two-week course of lessons on the feeling of heaviness, you can move on to this training, even if the previous stage is not fully mastered. Classes can be held in parallel. The technique should take you from 6 to 10 hours in duplicate over a period of 6 to 12 weeks. Strictly monitor the observance of the time frame, since this exercise is also associated with the ability to use the resources of your willpower.\n\nOnce again, at the slightest discomfort caused by the exercise, cancel the workout.\n\nThe method of sensation of heat is associated with relaxation of the walls of blood vessels. When a sensation of heat appears in your hand (left or right), it means the blood vessels begin to expand, while the sensation of gravity allows you to achieve a relaxed state of the muscles.\n\nThe new wording is: “My hand is warm.” The rule of the method is similar to the previous one: right-handed people focus attention on the right hand, left-handed – on the left.\n\nThe full course of the technique looks like this:\n\n\"I am completely calm\"\n\n\"My hand is warm\" – 6 times.\n\n\"I am completely calm\"\n\n\"My hand is warm\" – 6 times.\n\n\"I am completely calm\"\n\n\"My hand is warm\" – 6-12 times.\n\n“My arms and legs are relaxed and feel pleasantly warm” – 6 times.\n\n\"I am still calm\"\n\nTo get out of the state, one needs to reach the maximum tension in the hand, take a deep breath and open the eyes.\n\nYou can get out of the meditative state and in another way. Straighten, shake yourself, stretch heavily and take a deep, full yawn.\n\nMost often, the sensation of heat can be achieved faster than the sensation of gravity. If after two weeks you haven't been able to feel the heat in your hand, before exercise, place it in warm water or hold it near a warm battery. Cause this memory during exercise, and consciousness will immediately reproduce this state.\n\nA high degree of concentration on heat is felt better in your hand than in the forearm, since more “heat points” are concentrated in this place.\n\nWhy is this exercise necessary and what happens in the human body?\n\nIf there is heat in your hand, it means that your muscles are relaxed. Regular exercise leads to the emergence of this feeling faster and more intense, and ultimately this feeling can occur at the automatic level, as soon as you think about heaviness or heat. This is called an acquired reflex.\n\nIf the sensation of heat is due to the fact, that the walls of your blood vessels are relaxed, then the cold may indicate that blood circulation in the body is hampered.\n\nAn interesting study carried out within the framework of this methodology showed, that the exercise leads to actual changes in the physical condition of the body. So, for example, if both hands are put on the scales and the thought of warmth and gravity is on the left or right hand, then due to the increased blood flow, the weight of the hand will change! Also, with the help of a thermometer, the temperature of the arm was measured, to which the sensation of gravity was directed. Its degree can increase by as much as 2 points. This result is especially noticeable if the hands were cold before that.\n\nMany of those, who are engaged in this technique, in winter don’t even use gloves – they have enough mental concentration to warm their hands “from the inside”. Such people are themselves a source of energy. At the same time, it’s worth remembering, that the body needs to be carefully monitored and not to allow overvoltage.\n\nAnother interesting fact, related to this exercise, is that our vegetative system is a transmitter of impulses – there is a connection between the body and the brain in the form of interwoven nerve fibers. That is why, if you strain a certain group of muscles, this tension is transmitted to the next.\n\nSummarize. This training is designed to immerse the body in a relaxed state. Following the body, your consciousness sinks into this sensation, which contributes to the emergence of the so-called. relaxed concentration. I went on a further during exercising – experimental journey and transferred the sensation of heaviness to various parts of the body. The most effective is the feeling of warmth in the head. You literally feel the blood vessels expand, blood rushes to the head, and the brain begins to work more actively.\n\nSo, I can say, that this technique helped me to master the speed reading skills due to the ability to concentrate, to enter into a relaxed state. It combines several areas – meditation, autogenic training, stopping the internal dialogue.\n\nIn addition to these practices, I, as well as for training to stop the internal dialogue, collected several effective exercises in a separate section. I just want to note once again, that the meditative state is the relaxation of a higher order. Meditative practice is not always associated with asana (pose and state), the pronunciation of sacred sounds and breathing; it is more focused on the ability to concentrate on the main thing, which is the key for speed reading classes.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Meditation can help us embrace our worries, our fear, our anger; and that is very healing. We let our own natural capacity of healing do the work”, Thich Nhat Hanh\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nIn addition to meditation, there are several simple, but very effective exercises for concentration, which is the key to successful mental work.\n\nTry to train the ability to focus on the text with the help of mental reading of words backwards. When you mentally read a word backwards, you must spell it, and then read these letters. For example, \"market\" – \"tekram\", etc. If your mind is distracted by extraneous thoughts, you instantly lose the thread, then perform the exercise again, until you reach the state you need.\n\nThus, you can train your attention, being anywhere – at your work computer, on your way to work or school, while doing household chores, thereby using precious minutes with maximum benefit. Start with simple four-letter words. Gradually try to operate with longer words.\n\nNext, I would like to turn to such a problem as the narrow focus of our attention.\n\nIn addition to the fact, that we often don’t catch the details, that are in the area of ​​peripheral vision, we also miss the little things when looking at objects that are right in front of us. Try to look at any object unfamiliar to you and give a detailed description. How well did it happen? What did you miss?\n\nTo learn how to capture the details of surrounding objects under normal circumstances, try the following exercise once or twice every day for at least one minute.\n\nPick up any object and study it carefully from all sides. Keep looking at it until you are sure, that you remember it in all its details. Let us suppose, you are holding a little toy. Pay attention to the size, what colors are present on it, how many small things make up its surface, whether there are any inscriptions on it, what it may symbolize, what associations it causes you.\n\nYou’ll be surprised at how much new you learn about a simple object, that you have seen more, than once on the shelf, how many details you have not noticed before. Try to study the faces of friends and strangers in the same way, objects outside your home. The world will open for you from the new side.\n\nYou can also develop the ability to capture the smallest details by increasing the speed of perception of information, in addition to speed reading exercises. I suggest you try the following exercise, for the passage of which you will need an assistant.\n\nMake cards with different images or words – it can be figures, animal drawings, numbers or letters of different colors. It’s desirable to make them of such size, that the image was clearly visible. Ask friend to show you the cards as quickly as possible. The pace should be such as not to allow you to look at the cards for a longer period of time, which is required in order to quickly bring it before your eyes.\n\nAt first, you won’t be able to look at the image on the card, but after several sessions, you’ll understand, that it is becoming easier and simpler to disassemble the words written on the cards or to pick up the details. Use lateral vision – out of focus and focused vision allows maximum use of both central and peripheral vision. Try to notice everything that comes into view – the table, on which there is a plate of fruit, the landscape, that surrounds you during the walk.\n\nUsing all the above techniques and following the recommendations, you’ll notice, how speed reading comes easier and easier to you. In addition, your ability to explore the world will change. You’ll be able to see such a thing, that used to be lost among the scattered state, due to internal dialogue, dispersed look, hurried breathing. __________________________________________________________________\n\n“What does it take to be a champion? Desire, dedication, determination, concentration and the will to win”, Patty Berg\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nChapter 8. Analyze It\n\nThere is such an anecdote: \"People who say that a person uses only 10% of his brain, themselves use only 10% of their brain.\" But recently this opinion was elevated to the rank of truth and was widespread everywhere!\n\nScientists have proved, that if we used only the above-mentioned percentage, we would simply not be able to survive evolutionarily. We use the brain even when we sleep, not talking about the wakefulness phase! Brain activity is disabled only if this organ has received fatal damage.\n\nToday, research related to neuroscience is being actively developed. Being a passionate enthusiastic seeker of the answer to the question, as I think, I began to study research.\n\nOur brain consists of cell tissue, which in turn is a collection of nerve cells or – neurons. They occupy a certain place in the patency of nerve impulses and are responsible for the implementation of a reflex, forming signals for other nerve cells.\n\nIt was found, that the number of neurons in the head is about 100 billion! There is a whole Universe in our head, but we spend our resources on studying instructions for instant soup!\n\nNew studies, that were conducted by the neurologist Herkulano-Houzel show, that they are actually smaller. The researchers used the brain of four healthy (of course, before the end of life) men from 50 to 70 years. The result of the study showed, that in fact there are about 85 billion neurons in the brain, but not 100, as previously thought. Should add, that these 15 billion cells make up 1\/6 of the size of a healthy male's brain.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the size of the brain and the level of its development doesn’t depend on each other at all. But the number of neurons affects brain development and the key factors are:\n\nNeuronal system;\n\nThe connection of nerve cells or the amount of these compounds;\n\nThe ability of nerve cells to interact with each other.\n\nMany of my readers, probably, heard the fact, that the larger the head, the more intelligent a person is. However, I repeat, the size of the brain isn’t key in its development! For example, Einstein's brain weighed 1230g, while the brain of a healthy man reaches 2.000 grams. Thus, brain research hasn’t yet revealed a significant effect of any particular factor on intelligence. However, as I have already said, the key signs of development are the interconnection of neurons, which can be increased throughout life.\n\nFor example, Purkinje Effect, named after the founder of neuroscience, Jan Purkinje. Even at a young age, the scientist found a rather specific hallucination. At the first stage of the experiment, it’s necessary to close the eyes and look at the sun, and at the same time begin to open and close your eyes with your palms. After a few minutes of these manipulations, you can see colorful figures in front of you.\n\nAnd now lift your leg a little higher from the floor and begin to perform motor actions in the right direction. During these movements, start drawing the number six with your finger. Surprisingly, your foot will begin to move in the other direction (as well as figure 6), and it will be almost impossible to change the movement to the original one.\n\n! You are. And there is someone you want to be. The difference is what you start doing today.\n\nNeuroscientist Barry Gordon reports, that the brain has different departments, each department of which is engaged in the performance of its specific functions. Departments, that wouldn’t work, just doesn’t exist. If the cells of some of the divisions are inactive, they die. It’s the reason, that I strongly advocate the idea of ​​non-stop learning.\n\nImagine, that your brain is a complex mechanism, consisting of tiny metal screws and wheels. Information is an oil that lubricates parts. The better each element works, the more effective the operation of the mechanism as a whole. At that moment, when a person ceases to \"lubricate\" the debugged mechanism. Parts start to rust. The mechanism ceases to function and slowly produces the necessary actions. There is a degradation, after which it is very difficult to resume the smoothly running system.\n\n“It is neural connections, that help different areas of the brain to transmit data to each other, thereby ensuring the vital processes for us: memory formation, speech production and understanding, and control of the movements of our own body,” the scientists report.\n\nA group of scientists led by Stephen Smith from the Center for Functional MRI of the Brain at Oxford University decided to find out whether the total number of neural connections in the brain can affect its work as a whole. During the study, scientists used data from previous projects, on the basis of which a kind of \"map\" of the brain was compiled. With its help, you can understand, which area of ​​the brain is responsible for which process, and how the different areas of the brain interact with each other.\n\nAs a result of the work, it was managed to find out: the greater the number of neural connections present in the human brain, the more active it is. People whose brain was saturated with contacts between neurons have higher education, have no problems with the law, strive to lead a healthy lifestyle, are in good psychological condition and generally showed a high standard of living.\n\nAccording to the authors of the study, the relationship between the number of neural connections and the quality of human life was so obvious that the researchers themselves were amazed at the results.\n\nThus, it turns out, that the development of the brain directly depends on the continuous “feeding” of neural connections. I consider effective reading to be one of the most important forms of “nutrition” of brain activity.\n\nI emphasize on efficiency, because regular reading doesn’t lead to full results. For example, you can read a treatise on medieval knightly campaigns at a speed of 1000 words per minute. But if at the same time you don’t understand the text and cannot explain it clearly then, then the efficiency of reading is zero. The same principle applies to the quality of texts. If your chosen book is a vivid example of modern fiction, then you will not gain new knowledge, on the contrary, you can easily degrade to the level of fiction novels.\n\nIn this chapter I will talk about how to learn to read so, that the effect of reading is maximized. So, after you finish reading a good text, you feel how new neural connections are created, how clearly you think, how the brain requires more and more healthy, and wholesome food.\n\nLet's start with the basics. Each action should have a clear goal, i.e. reading should be directed. You must clearly represent the result, that you want to get after reading the treatise, journal, notes. You can use reading to solve a difficult problem, get an answer, feel pleasure – the goal in this case affects the inner mind, according to the principle of a signal that helps to achieve the desired effect.\n\nArmed with a clear goal, you should move to a level of relaxed vigilance, which is necessary for accelerated learning. You should be making efforts in the process, but you not be worried about the result that is already laid on the cortex of the brain. Imagine, that you playfully read the book – you don’t worry, you know exactly, what you are doing and why.\n\nAfter you have designated the goal, you should study the “appearance” of the book – its cover with all useful content. Is the author's name say to you something? Remember some echoes, that may indicate his competence. Analyze the name to make sure it matches the goal. Look at the content. Perhaps, there are chapters, that are not interesting to you and you should focus your attention on specific paragraphs.\n\nAfter a preliminary \"acquaintance\" I recommend referring to reviews. Many times this information saved me from wasting time. I compose whole \"trees\" from books, when I see, that one author readily recommends certain works of a colleague. Carefully read those books that are of practical use – they may contain tips about where to turn for the next “portion” of the necessary information.\n\nThe next important step is preview, which should become a habit.  Preview ensures you 100 percent effectiveness, as you study a subject before proceeding to study it. Do you try on clothes before you buy them? Are you studying a movie review before you go to the cinema? Reading shouldn’t be an exception.\n\nThis chapter will help you to save a considerable amount of time without losing the quality of information perception. Thanks to simple tips you will learn how to:\n\nDo not waste time on already familiar texts or unnecessary materials with just a quick glance;\n\nPenetrate deeper into the texts, that you decide to read after the preview;\n\nFind and establish points or some kind of reference points, denoting the importance and usefulness of information, even at the stage of a quick review of texts;\n\nMaster new areas of knowledge faster and better.\n\nYou should start with the effective viewing technique, which will help you to read the desired text several times faster than your usual speed.\n\nHow can you understand the main idea of ​​the text just by looking at it? Is it achievable? Based on my own experience, I can answer this question in the affirmative – you can! Most often, the essence of any information field is located approximately in the same places. Any text has its own laws of construction. The author concentrates the main idea in strictly defined places of the book or article. Sometimes it’s enough for an experienced look to find this place, make a quick view and not read the entire text.\n\nThe typical structure of any text is based on the Socrates description: first it’s necessary to learn, what the author wants to inform, then to give out the information, and then explain it to the reader. Having considerable experience in writing various texts, beginning with the university, a familiar copywriter told me about the elementary construction of any text, be it a report or a whole dissertation:\n\nThe introductory part, containing the formulation of goals and objectives, a brief description of the subject of study or research;\n\nThe main section, containing theoretical and practical materials;\n\nConclusion, where the main conclusions are concentrated, summing up and recent recommendations;\n\nAfter reading this book, evaluate its structure and answer the question, whether it corresponds to this scheme.\n\nWhatever text you may discover, fiction or highly specialized, you’ll always find the trinity mentioned above, with these or other variations. Even in postmodern literature, no matter how complicated or confusing it is, you’ll always find acquaintance with the characters, the development of the plot and the denouement of the plot. However, the preview is of little use for acquaintance with the world classics, however, it is almost irreplaceable for studying scientific literature.\n\nThe principle of the preview is based on the method of evaluating the text “from the general to the particular”. First, you evaluate the whole picture and only after that proceed to a detailed study. Scroll through the book of your choice. Even at the moment of the flickering of words, sentences and paragraphs, your look will surely “pull out” several keywords, on the basis of which it’s possible to draw a conclusion about the content of the entire book.\n\nThen you can flip through the book a little more slowly – you’ll see its structure, how it’s divided into chapters, how key words and phrases are highlighted. Imagine, that you meet a new friend, you study his appearance, listen to his voice, ask his name and learn a profession. Believe me, some texts will become your real friends!\n\nAfter you are done with the introductory part, the preview begins. This process takes about five minutes for book, about three – for report, three for report and only 30 seconds for article. Throughout this process, you compare the text with the goal, identify key points and decide whether to continue reading or finish it at this stage. Don’t be afraid to refuse to read just because you have already taken the book in your hands and it seems a pity for you to postpone it. If already at the preview stage it doesn’t represent value for you, then why waste time on its full study?\n\nPreview is a scanning mechanism, i.e. obtaining general information, that acts as a scheme or image of the text. You receive or don’t receive confirmation of your own expectations, thanks to which the reading process becomes more efficient and enjoyable. In the subconscious you have already outlined a plan for reading, you have already created in your head the outline of a particular publication, which you will gradually fill with meaning, details, facts, names.\n\nAnother trick of the preview is that the human brain perceives only familiar objects. The more you know about the content of the text, the easier it will be for reading and reflection.\n\nYou should not pay too much time to the review – if the time is running longer than expected (see the information above), then you are already reading in the usual slow way. The review should contribute to the compilation of the mental plan of the readable text, which significantly increases its chances of being captured in memory for a long time.\n\n! Speed ​​reading is not a crazy speed of reading – it’s a search for the right text and the most effective assimilation.\n\nThe speed reading technique is set up according to the same principle: the goal is set → the content is explored (table of contents) → the general structure is viewed at an accelerated rate, the important terms and keywords are marked → the places, where the most important information is marked – the text is read in an accelerated mode with pauses in the right places.\n\nInformation during the views will be set aside on the subconscious and in the future it can be activated as necessary at the level of intuition. For this, it’s only necessary to enter into a special state associated with concentration.\n\nAs soon as you develop the habit of pre-evaluating the text, you can automatically and intuitively select the materials you need.\n\nWe now turn to a more complex issue – separation of the wheat from the chaff, i.e. we will learn to get rid of information garbage. How to learn to identify it in advance and ignore?\n\nHere we are assisted by a prepared in advance consciousness. You can program it according to the following scheme:\n\nGet rid of unnecessary thoughts (remember the lessons to stop the internal dialogue);\n\nSet and present the ultimate goal of reading;\n\nComprehend those facts and information that you already know about the subject of reading;\n\nApproximately designate those keywords, that must necessarily be in the text and what the desired information may be;\n\nNow you need to view the text until the subconscious itself gives a signal to stop and engage in in-depth reading.\n\nSpeaking of keywords, I mean the so-called anchor words (they are often used in online advertising). They attract attention, as if they are asking to stop, a glance clings to them – hence their name. In fact, they serve as reference points on which to rely at the time of studying the text. They suggest the subject and content of any text.\n\nAnchor words help the mind to formulate questions for inner comprehension. They act as target objects of the brain in the process of fast reading and contribute to the activation of special attention.\n\nBy tuning your brain to pre-recognition, you significantly simplify the task that needs to be solved during the actual implementation of the reading.\n\nThe next stage of comprehension of the text is its perception. It is based on four levels: preparedness, in-depth preparation, knowledge and special knowledge.\n\nThe process of knowledge of the text is determined by the science of hermeneutics (the science of interpretation). What the words are composed of – letters and syllables – do not represent an informational meaning. They act only as code marks on the basis of which words are formed. Moreover, not even words and sentences are the goal of reading, the meaning, the thought that they express. Understanding the text is directly related to the full disclosure of its meaning or value.\n\nIn order to fully reveal the basic idea, to understand the text, it’s necessary to perform a number of specific actions.\n\nWhat is understanding in its essence? Psychologists testify, that understanding is the process of establishing logical connections between objects by using existing baggage of knowledge. For example, we read: \"The builders built a house.\" We have knowledge of what the profession of \"builder\" is, we know, that exactly buildings are being built, we know, that the \"house\" is the box, in which people live. We understand the meaning of the read. Reading a simple text is connected with an understanding, that merges with perception – we instantly recall the knowledge, obtained earlier or choose from the existing knowledge, that we need at the moment and link them together with new impressions. However, most often, while reading an unfamiliar or difficult text, understanding the essence is a complex, additional effort.\n\nFor a complete understanding of the reading, you must be careful and be able to apply the knowledge gained. In addition, for effective reading, you should be aware of certain thinking techniques. Most commonly used are two basic techniques: the allocation of semantic data points and anticipation.\n\nData points are semantic groups into which any text is divided. They are designed to deeper understanding of the text and facilitate the subsequent memorization of information. Additional details, nuances, secondary words or facts may also act as supporting points. In the final sense, understanding is reduced to encompassing the text as a set of basic ideas, keywords, capacious phrases that precede the text of subsequent pages.\n\nUnderstanding of the text occurs at the moment, when the reader reduces the content of the material to specific logical formulas, marking in them the central semantic core, creating an associative array and thus reproducing a logical chain of thoughts. Strong points act as filters that allow the text to form into a concise basis, without losing a single significant component.\n\nThe next technique is the semantic guess. This is a psychological process, consisting in orientation to the expected future. Based on knowledge of logic laws of logic about the development of action, the ability to use the results of analysis, recognition - all these is provided by the so-called “wait reaction”. It’ a sort of adjusting the reader to certain guesses, when the text seems to have no sufficient basis for these reactions.\n\nIn the course of a special training session, it’s possible to develop the ability to instantly anticipate, by indirect (secondary) semantic features of the text, subsequent events.\n\nIf you see a signal in the text, that you can recognize, for example, by several initial letters, to guess the whole word or, by several words, the subsequent phrase, and by several sentences – the meaning of the whole paragraph or even a page, it means that your mind can process subconsciously information based on logic and previous experience. With this method of reading you rely more on the content of the text as a whole than on the meaning of individual words.\n\nSo, for example, reading a text familiar to you, you foresee how the disclosure of the main content will develop. Well knowing biology, you, having seen, the word \"organic\", for certain, can foresee the continuation of the word combination – \"life\". Possessing the technique of understanding the idea of ​​content, you can easily comprehend the main idea of ​​the author of the text.\n\nThus, when learning to read quickly, the ability to find strong points and build semantic guesses is the main factor in the formation of a peculiar recognition of phrase stamps, which significantly speed up and make better the very understanding of the text. Identifying textual stereotypes is one of the primary conditions for the development of automatic semantic word processing.\n\nOn the basis of these developments, you can easily avoid the danger, when already in the process of reading you found a lot of “water” in it, and your desire to read it begins to evaporate instantly.\n\nThe final stage of the analysis is its study. For me, it is significant for the reason, that without due doubt, accompanied by a multitude of questions, there is no meaningful process of thinking.\n\nUltimately, any book generates more questions than answers. Blind faith in information can be a source of erroneous information. Of course, to a lesser extent this applies to the exact sciences, but what if you got into the hands of a book of an unscrupulous author?\n\nAt this level of analysis, I recommend turning to the opinion of the American psychologist, linguist, scientist Robert Anton Wilson. Many of his works on language issues reveal the true meaning of the texts we read.\n\nAccording to his book “The New Inquisition, all people, as a species, live in a world of endless informational signals. When we structure this information environment, the world makes sense to us. The structuring model is formed at the level of our biology and sociology.\n\nSo, if we are completely hypnotized by a certain tunnel of reality, we are able to reach fanaticism. The fact is that initially we have certain attitudes, which hinders our development. They are embedded deep in the subconscious and even unconscious. Such attitudes are often called stereotypes, that don’t allow us to think more widely, to go beyond the ordinary.\n\nAt this moment, our reasoning, inference, loses logic, and we cease to think rationally. We trust common truths that are not questioned. But doubt is our main ally in the search for truth.\n\nI will give an example with the verb “is” (for example, in the statement “A is B”). This logic is very useful in mathematics, since \"concepts and objects with which it operates, exist abstractly, that is, by definition.\" But what happens when we apply the principle of direct definition to certain abstract concepts? Think about the meaning of such statements as “Mona Lisa is a great work of art”, “This is real nonsense”, “This is the best song”, “Justin Bieber is the best singer in the world”? Do you agree with each of them? From the point of view of neurology, these statements should be formulated differently: “I think this is a great work of art”, “In my opinion, this is utter nonsense”, “It seems like the best song”, “From my point of view, he is the best singer”,\n\nInstead of “all modern music is bad” one can say “not all modern music seems bad to me”. By applying this assessment to what you read and to your own areas of life, you’ll significantly expand the boundaries of use and understanding of information. For example, having read the statement of any figure, try to evaluate his message critically, look at it from a different angle, try to compare his opinion with the opinion of his opponents and allies.\n\n! What did you do today to achieve your goal?\n\nAt the end of the chapter I would like to give you a creative task. Rate statement \"Everyone can master the speed reading.\" What emotions does it cause you? What emotions did it evoke before you read the book? Return to it after you have studied all the material and respond to it again.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“When you see opportunities in your life, you've got to analyze, 'Why was that choice given to me?”, Tom DeLonge\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nChapter 9. Long-Term Memory\n\nStudying speed reading, I realized, that in the process of reading memory is a key. Just imagine, that at the level of consciousness in one session you can perceive up to seven (or even more) bits of information! Researches of scientists proved, that cells of a human brain can store six times more information than a whole volume of an encyclopedia. There are no exact numbers at the moment, but the “free space” in the brain is estimated at 1 petabyte (1000 terabytes), which is quite capacious.\n\nOur brain is essentially a computer in which we store information. As necessary we retrieve the “files” – we recall the name of a classmate, the name of the sort of apples, the names of favorite book movie characters. Scientists also confirmed, that the brain stores absolutely every information element, that enters through a visual or hearing aid. During the experiments related to hypnosis, it was revealed, that some people can remember even those languages ​​that have not studied or those cases of life that happened to them even in infancy!\n\nWhy is it so difficult to remember the lecture given the other day or the content of the article studied the day before?\n\nPsychologists distinguish two types of memory – short-term and long-term.\n\nShort-term memory is capable of holding material that is not directly related to the fingerprint of sensory information. In this case, the stored information is not expressed in a literal display of events that occurred at the level of perception, but directly the interpretation of these events. I will give an example. You have read a certain piece of text. You don’t memorize syllables and letters, but only a general meaning or individual words. As a rule, short-term memory allows you to capture only 5-6 elements of the text. For example, from the phrase “Short-term memory is capable of holding material that is not directly related to the fingerprint of sensory information,” you are most likely able to repeat only a few words. Conscious effort aimed at repetition of the material, you can hold it in memory for an indefinitely long time.\n\nLong-term memory is the most important and most complex of human memory systems. There is a clear distinction between the memory of an event that just happened and those events that happened a long time ago. The capacity of short-term memory is significantly limited: several storage units. Of course, some boundaries of long-term memory exist, since the brain is not an infinite device. The brain consists of 10 billion neurons, each of which is able to hold a huge amount of information. It is so large that it can practically be considered that some scientists come to the conclusion, that the memory capacity of the human brain is not limited. All that is held in memory for more than a few minutes is sent to the department of long-term memory.\n\nThe main difficulty associated with long-term memory is the problem of searching, finding and extracting information. The amount of information contained in the memory, as I said above, is infinitely large, therefore, is associated with serious difficulties of \"storage\". Our task is to learn how to find and use the information received.\n\nWhy is it important to remember information? Because it needs to be used. Imagine, that you bought an encyclopedia, which contains everything, absolutely all knowledge of the world. If it gathers dust on the bookshelf, the sense will be zero. The same thing happens during a speed reading – material that you learned should remain available for use. The application of knowledge gained in practice is the meaning of reading!\n\nAt its core, the process of memorizing reading consists of two stages:\n\nKeeping information in attention. Attention can be compared with the instant memory of a computer – access to it occurs almost instantly, but on the other hand, such memory has a limited amount, because after turning off the computer, the memory is erased. Developing attention, the reader simultaneously increases the amount of short-term memory.\n\nLong-term memorizing of read material. Just reading the text is not enough –  the main thing is to place information in the compartment of the human's long-term memory, which resembles a computer hard disk. And here the main problem – you can remember, but how to remember (the name of the file, or a clue) is impossible.\n\nFiguratively speaking, in order for the memorization process to be effective, it is necessary to focus on the information received, place it in the fast memory section, pass through the short-term as a transformation tool, “drive” into the long-term memory compartment, where to learn to extract it.\n\nFor this, I offer my readers a number of exercises.\n\nScatter a few matches on the table (or pins or toothpicks). Close your eyes and try to restore the arrangement of the matches, how they are scattered, what shapes formed. Starting with a few pieces, increase the number and complicate the task.\n\nMultiply in memory two-digit or three-digit numbers. This practice won’t only improve your mathematical and analytical abilities, but also improve attention and concentration ability. The more you train, the more perfect the short-term memory will be, and after a few weeks the training will be long-term.\n\nThere are also several tricks and tricks that help to fix the text in memory:\n\nPurpose\n\nJust before reading a book or magazine, spend some time thinking about the purpose of reading. You can put into practice thinking, how you can apply information in work or everyday life. The better you present the end goal, the more you prepare for reading and tune in to memorizing useful information. Just think, how sometimes it’s important not to memorize information, but to get the opportunity to properly use it. Use, for example, this method – draw a map on a piece of paper and follow the specified route. As soon as you reach the finish line, throw away the drawing. This will help to understand the principle of reading.\n\nRemember, that thinking about the purpose of reading programs the subconscious to search for the necessary information. It is worth spending on drawing up the formulation of the goal and its visualization for a few minutes so that the brain receives the necessary energy and correct installation.\n\nEmotional text binding\n\nPeople often remembers information, that is associated with certain emotions better. That’s why fiction is much easier to memorize – text can make us laugh, upset or even frighten. I noticed, that in a stressful situation I memorize events much better. For example, during an important and responsible meeting, it’s enough for me only to glance at the figures of the report, and I can immediately reproduce them.\n\nTry to practice your memory in some difficult situations. For example, you can read a book, sitting on a cliff, or in a crowded bus. At this point, concert the attention at the maximum – the brain will get an interesting experience, which afterwards can be transferred to the practice independently.\n\nVisualize\n\nHave you noticed, how during reading a certain voice sounds in your head that speaks like a text? This process isn’t related to articulation, rather, it resembles a distant speaker text. Try to convert it into images. Visualize the text. Do it first at a slow reading speed, but gradually increase the pace as soon as you start to get it.\n\nMainstream thinking\n\nPeriodically stop while reading and reflect on what you have just read. Get time to stop and think, how the information you just learned relates to what you knew before. Establishing such connections is called backbone thinking – you compare the material with the previously studied one, draw conclusions and make new logical connections. After reading a small passage of text, consider whether the selected text will help you find the answer to the question you are looking for. Rate the benefits of new knowledge.\n\nOpen questions\n\nThe more voluminous, the more detailed you process the received information, the better you remember – the system of open questions contributes to author of the text. How the text was created, what goals the author pursued, what would you like to clarify with him. The more questions you have in your head, the wider the associative array, the better the brain processes information and leaves these answers “for later”. If there is a need to remember information related to the text, the brain will generate open-ended questions and extract the necessary \"file\".\n\nNote sin the margin\n\nTake notes by hand or typing on a computer. Change the wording of the knowledge gained, transforming it into an internal code. The more you use your fingers and motor skills, the better remember the information.\n\nAfter the information is read, it must be moved to long-term memory. For this, it must be understood. However, it’s not enough for confident and lasting memorization. Sometimes elementary repetition is required. This should be done not just by memorizing the information, but by a certain algorithm that was developed by Herman Ebbinghaus.\n\nSurely, you had a situation, where a voluminous text is necessary not only to study, but to remember it well? And it needs to be done in just a few days? Try to follow the system below.\n\nThe first session is repeated after the end of the reading;\n\nThe second session is repeated 30 minutes after the end of the reading;\n\nThe third session is repeated 8 hours after the end of the reading;\n\nThe fourth session is repeated after 32 hours after the end of the reading.\n\nIf you do not have time limits, increase the amount of text and use the following algorithm:\n\nThe first session is repeated after the end of the reading;\n\nThe second session is repeated 30 minutes after the end of the reading;\n\nThe third session is repeated a day after the end of the reading;\n\nThe fourth session is repeated two weeks after the end of the reading;\n\nThe fifth session is repeated two months after the end of the reading.\n\nBefore you go to the second level, practice the first thoroughly. Do some such training – you will notice, how you can increase the amount of text in a month, as more and more details remain in your memory. Each type and block of information requires a certain reading speed, which corresponds to the previous experience of the reader.\n\nDuring the practice of memorizing text at high speed reading, follow a few simple rules:\n\nSwitch to another job. Let it be purely mechanical exercises or workout. The brain needs rest in order not to get an overload.\n\nAlternate text types – humanitarian and technical.\n\nUse backbone thinking to make sense of what you read.\n\nRead the text at the peak of interest. Consciously increase your passion for a particular topic. To do this, clearly set a goal and imagine the ultimate goal of reading – the use of useful material in practice.\n\nBe sure to combine the practices listed here with training on simulators.\n\nChange the pace of reading.\n\nDiscuss text with friends, colleagues or family members. Information that is spoken out loud will “settle” better in long-term memory.\n\nThink up reading methods, for example, search for a fact, tell a story to a friend, etc.\n\nWork through the information using the analysis methods from the previous chapter.\n\nIf this method seems too complicated to you, I suggest a system developed by Ebbinghaus (American expert in the field of speed reading). He significantly simplified the algorithm, reducing it to several stages, which you, as an attentive reader, are already familiar with:\n\nTune in to the reading process. Think about the goal. Think of how you will use the information received.\n\nView text.\n\nTake a break.\n\nThink about what you learned from the new text.\n\nReview the text again.\n\nTake a break.\n\nBefore the next viewing of the text be sure to think about what you read. Thereby you will remember better.\n\nAnother method for effective memorization is scanning reading method. It consists in the following.\n\nChoose and purchase several books on the topic you need. One of them should be a textbook or study aid.\n\nLook at pages five to ten of the first of the books. Pay attention to the author’s examples and highlighted places (bold or italic, framed text, etc.) in the text.\n\nView the second book from the fifth page to the tenth and all subsequent in the same way.\n\nConsider and evaluate, which of the authors best covers your topic, which style you understand more, how dense is the concentration of meaning on the pages studied. Browse through the most liked places of the book selected as a result of the analysis.\n\nUsing this method of reading, you repeatedly repeat the same type of text (I mean the semantic load). Terms that were unknown at the very beginning of the text will become more and more clear by the end of the reading process.\n\n! A good technique gives a skill that stays with you for life.\n\nHuman brain has tremendous memorization abilities. I consider the most effective method of memorization, which I decided to make more detailed. It’s called \"Filtering\".\n\nI want to once again stop at the moment, that as soon as you read an interesting article or note, it doesn’t mean, that it immediately went to the department of long-term memory. Your brain gives a signal: “This article is interesting. I remember something. But if I need information, I will re-read the article again.”\n\nOnly after you stop, pause and mentally analyze the text, it will place in the memory section. It should become part of your memory, merge with the information received earlier, be placed on a separate shelf with the possibility of taking advantage of it when necessary.\n\nRemember, that value is something that has been invested a lot of power. That is, the more effort you spend on the text, the more likely you are to remember it well. Do it right now. Stop, think what you read. Now this book has become part of your experience, part of consciousness. After reading this chapter, be sure to use the information that you have learned from it!\n\nLet's go directly to the technique.\n\nStop signal. Have you read the passage to the end? Pause, even if the following information is very interesting. The pause can be very short – less than a second, but it must be done.\n\nSense core. Present the read material as a diagram, situation or image. The basis of this image should be the main semantic content of the text. Long-term memory better takes information, that seems to be the most important, which is captured in the imaginative system of thinking. On average, this exercise is given no more than ten seconds.\n\nSpeak out loud. Briefly and succinctly describe in your own words the image of the aspect you presented. Make the offer as short as possible. Be sure to speak the essence clearly and loudly. If there is no one near you, if you are among people, it can be done in a whisper. It takes this part on average up to half a minute.\n\nHaving made a similar \"filtering\" of the text, write the thesis on paper. Right now, stop the reading process and do the exercises above. I'll wait, the text will wait, but not your memory. In front of you is the most comfortable simulator in the world, which you can immediately use in practice. This book was created taking into account the tasks for the solution of which you are now reading the next chapter.\n\nText filtering is designed to ensure, that you receive and put into practice the heart of useful information. The ultimate goal of any book, article, essay, note, textbook, manual, etc., lies precisely in the fact, that you should use knowledge to its fullest extent. By changing knowledge, you are changing life. Just imagine, how much interesting and wonderful knowledge you have gained in your life! And how much is left in the memory?\n\nAfter you finish reading this chapter, do the following:\n\nReflect the possibilities of using the material.\n\nVisualize desired result.\n\nApply it in practice.\n\nTo better understand each of the actions, ask yourself the appropriate questions:\n\nHow can I use this knowledge to improve my life?\n\nHave there been any situations in my life when I would need (very strongly) this information? What would I have done in the past, do I have this information?\n\nWhat field of activity will improve due to new knowledge? Will this help my career or personal life? Public or for personal growth?\n\nAsk your own questions! Whenever you read a text that is useful to you, analyze it in such a way that it will bring maximum benefit! If you do not know what particular benefit the reading can give, go to the next text. The more actively you practice the interpretation and processing of the text, the more practical answers you will find for your personal experience.\n\nThe next aspect of successful reading and memorization is the “Visualization of the result”. Having decided to implement the text after the text processing, visualize the idea. Imagine a real situation in which you implement the information received.\n\nFor example, you read an article about how to conduct a mathematical analysis of labor productivity. Imagine, how this knowledge will be useful to you in your subsequent work. How you can show off knowledge, how to increase production indicators and how much profit you can get. Submitted? Saturate each text with pleasant associations so that the brain strives and is motivated to receive benefits.\n\n! If dream is stronger than fear, it will come true!\n\nOur brain is designed in such a way, that if you repeatedly play the necessary scenario in your imagination, then the probability of its successful implementation increases significantly. This is how the winners set themselves up before the competition – they already see themselves mentally on the pedestal. Having imagined several times, the process of implementing your achievements, you, at the moment when it comes, you will be firmly aware of what needs to be done and how. Your subconscious will fix the algorithm of actions.\n\nI would like to say separately about the stage “Translating vision into reality”. If, after working through the idea, it became clear to you, that you can immediately, without leaving your place, apply conclusions in life and this will be of benefit to you, then put the book aside and implement your plans immediately. And only after that go back to reading. If the implementation of the project (action) takes from 3 to 5 minutes, then assess the degree of importance of this process. If time and conditions play a key role, do not “slow down”, the sooner you embrace knowledge, the sooner the success of the read will be fixed. But if the embodiment of new ideas can wait for more than five, use the technique \"Waiting list\", which will be discussed further.\n\nHow is this technique applied? While working on the text, take a pen and a blank sheet of paper and write down the name of the book or article. After reading, perform all the “Filtration” stages, making notes along the way on the pages. After each thesis leave a little empty space. To make additional thoughts after reading the entire text.\n\nTo successfully learn what you read, remember that:\n\nThe head should be free from extraneous thoughts. If you are thinking of an upcoming party with colleagues, you will not be able to properly evaluate the text.\n\nThink about the specific text that lies before you. Do not jump from one topic to another until you have fixed the result by the method of filtering information.\n\nEvaluate information on a utility scale. It’s worth spending a second or two to do this, to either discard it as unnecessary, or put it on the “Waiting List” with the appropriate notes. If you spend the time now, you don’t have to spend even more precious minutes in the future.\n\nThe effectiveness of reading is to be concentrated at each stage of reading. The same applies to memorization. Unfortunately, our brain is designed in such a way, that it rarely manages to reproduce all stages of thinking at the same speed. That’s why pauses between semantic blocks are so important. If you have taken the Handbook on the grammar of Finno-Ugric peoples in your hands, then don’t jump to Quantum Psychology. Give your brain to comprehend, accept and enter into the long-term memory the necessary information.\n\nThe technique I described allowed me to improve my memory quality. I not only trained this skill, but also learned to discard the unnecessary, that which litters the memory, doesn’t allow it to increase the amount of useful knowledge.\n\nFinally, I would like to give a few more general recommendations that will be useful to you in everyday life.\n\nLive mentally your day from beginning to end, and then in a separate order. Consider the number of doors or steps that can be opened, which you went down and climbed. Try to remember the names of all with whom you happened to meet.\n\nThese small tricks will help you improve memory, because it is not at all necessary, according to the old method, to memorize poems and sayings, as we were taught this in school. Choose comfortable for yourself practice, from which you will enjoy.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Memory is the treasure house of the mind wherein the monuments thereof are kept and preserved”, Thomas Fuller\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSpin up the brain: Exercises\n\nA separate part of the book, which, nevertheless, is practical, I would like to devote to the selection of techniques and methods that I collected and tested on my own experience. Having studied these techniques, you’ll probably ask yourself the question: what, in fact, do they have to do with speed reading?\n\nI repeat (both in theoretical and in practical chapters) that speed reading is more the way of thinking than a technique in its pure form. This is the purpose of my work – to bring thinking to a completely different level in order to ensure the breadth of knowledge of the world around us, elevated to absolute.\n\nBelow are the techniques that help master the technique of meditation, stop internal dialogue, develop intuition, bring information processing at a deeper level. Many of the techniques listed below help to relieve headaches, soothe during stress, i.e. possess healing properties. Since the book is more interactive, I suggest, that readers choose the most interesting techniques, select those that, in your opinion, will bring you maximum benefit. Some of these techniques are quite easy to master, some require more than one month to develop skills. Start with the simplest, moving further. The main thing is not to stop!\n\nFor convenience, I marked each exercise with a separate color:\n\nPurple – stopping internal dialogue\n\nGreen – for defocusing\n\nBlue – meditation to enter into a state of peace and concentration\n\nLight blue – to control speaking\n\nRed – for the formation of new neural connections\n\nSo, I propose to begin the journey into the world of pure and enlightened mind!\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nImagine, that you are on the shore of the reservoir. Lake, river, sea, ocean –  what is closer to your soul. The surface of the water is smooth and even. Listen to yourself, to your thoughts. Project your mind on the surface of the reservoir and imagine, every thought is a ripple on the water. Do you feel the pressure of thoughts in your head? Pay attention to the lake, how many waves, how powerful they are, how they excite the water. Try to hear the sound of the waves, feel the disturbing smell of the storm. Now try to calm down, take a few deep breaths. Do you see how the thoughts calm down, and the lake or the sea comes back to a calm state? The ripples slowly disappear. Again, the clear blue of the pool reflects the gentle sun.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nImagine a circle in a certain space in your head. Project the flow of your thoughts on this circle, pass them through its center. Keep your thoughts in a circle. Feel the peace. Every time a stream of uncontrollable thoughts starts to overwhelm you, imagine how the ball vibrates. The stronger and more deliberate the thought, the stronger the circle shifts. To turn off the flow, stop the motion of the ball, balance it in its original position. The task of the exercise is to keep the ball still at rest.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nTo stop the internal dialogue while walking or staying in a public place, start bending and unbending your fingers first on one hand, then on the second. Don’t think about anything else. At first, outside thoughts will begin to come to mind – scraps of songs or poems, but gradually the stream of consciousness will stop. Don’t concentrate on the process itself – just go to a “different” state, as if someone else is hiding behind your head in flexion and extension. Later you can transfer this exercise to speed reading, but only after you master this simple technique in everyday life.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nFocus not on your own thoughts, but on sensations and images. Don’t pronounce thoughts, but try to feel them. Remember the speed reading technique when you grab more than one word from the text, as if you are creating an image of a paragraph or passage. Thinking thus acquires a completely different quality – a similar state after a certain time will arise naturally.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nDoes it ever happen to you that while doing something (in our case, reading) you are haunted by a piece of annoying song or poem? Get rid of annoying thoughts can be quite simple. Most often, the rhythmic text sounds in the head not entirely, but in the form of a small segment. As soon as the passage ends, the brain immediately throws the thought to the beginning. And so in a vicious circle. It is necessary to reduce this segment to the minimum size. Up to one or two sounds or words. Repeat this brief passage with the same rhythm until the brain “agrees” with the substitution. After a couple of minutes, the brain will be so tired of monotonous sounds that it will stop returning to them.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nTo stop the internal dialogue is very useful to identify the area where the flow of consciousness. To do this, it’s necessary to strengthen the voice, voicing the thoughts in your head. Examine it by adding volume – what is its timbre, intonation, density, how voluminous is it, to whom does it belong? Try to even mentally present it in volume, adding color, temperature, etc. to the specified characteristics. After that, step back from this voice, make it absolutely “alien”. The distance can be reproduced by reducing its volume, mentally move your voice away from your I. Now change its parameters and watch your own sensations. Try to classify the thoughts that arise in your head and give them different colors. As soon as you manage to do this, you will be able to determine the most effective ways of removing and changing the internal state.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternal dialogue is concentrated solely in your head. It sounds deliberate or not, but it is concentrated here. Imagine that at the expense of thoughts you feel the head much brighter than all other parts of the body. Now transfer this sensation to the feet, imagine that the mental flow is concentrated in them (at first it will seem strange, but little by little the brain will cease to be too straightforward). Over time, the internal dialogue will stop, but there is no need to stop. Carry this sensation on the whole body – calves, legs, thighs, stomach, chest, neck. Fill the whole body with feeling for greater harmony. Exercise lasts an average of five minutes. After you can relax. After several sessions, you’ll be able to make sure, that you can control not only the internal dialogue, but also know your body better.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nYou can train an internal dialogue with the help of attention concentration exercises. To do this, you need to focus your sight on the object at a distance of 7–20 meters while walking. The main thing is not to lower the gaze down in any case, otherwise the stream of consciousness will immediately resume. For example, you left the house and immediately fixed your eyes on a nearby tree. As you approach, transfer your sight to the next object, say a lantern, and so on. This technique helps to keep the flow of thoughts on the path of the whole following and trains internal concentration.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nA very interesting practice for brain training is gibberish. An interesting technique created by Sufi monks. It lies in the fact that you need to close your eyes and start uttering meaningless sounds, gradually turning them into utter nonsense. You can try to reproduce the invented language, like the one in which children often talk. For fifteen minutes, try to immerse yourself in the verbalization of thoughts and sensations you have invented. Through this practice, you are released from everything that your mind is focused on. You don’t repress thoughts, but look for a new way of expressing them. After this exercise, you will feel how light the head and your body as a whole have become.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThere is a very tight connection between the thought process and the micro movements of the eyes (visual center) – every thought is accompanied by involuntary micro movement, which is consonant with it. You can use it in the opposite direction – to stop eye movement to stop the flow of thoughts. If it’s difficult for you to make an effort of will, imagine, that at the bottom of the pupils you put small weights, that don’t allow them to make the slightest movement. Pupils are motionless – thoughts calm down. It should be noted, that this practice allows you to better understand the connection of thought and optic nerves.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThe interruption of the internal dialogue can also be triggered by the visualization method. Imagine, that you are deep, deep under water. Water penetrated your body, filled it to the brim. Breathing is smooth and calm. As soon as a thought appears in your mind, transform it into a small bubble and imagine how it, having separated from your head and is carried away by the flow.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nHave you ever tried to track the flow of your thoughts? Surely it happens, that you start to think, for example, about the products from which you will cook dinner, and then, waking up, you did understand, that you are talking about what black holes consist of? The associative series are awesome! Try to carry out the procedure of reflection of thoughts – where they come from, how they flow, what they turn into. You’ll be surprised, but some of them will seem strangers, as if they were not yours, who came from nowhere. They appear in the head and flow in a chaotic manner. Watch them flow. Don’t cling to a separate thought, don’t try to control it. Mentally contemplate the general background of the unconscious flow. After a while you’ll notice how they subside, become as if thinner, and then completely dissolve.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nRelease the internal dialogue. Let him scream inside. Let all your thoughts get space for jogging through consciousness. But at some point, even while reading, stop abruptly and say out loud: “Stop!”. The brain will shake and, will try to interrupt the process, having received the prohibitive installation. It’s very useful to use stop signals that were received in childhood, for example, “Stop!”, “Enough!”, etc. This same technique is very useful when we are disoriented. It is worth exclaiming \"I am here and now,\" as the brain immediately throws consciousness at the moment. You can look around and continue to act meaningfully.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTo stop the internal dialogue, use the practice of total darkness. Close your eyes tightly. No light source should penetrate the eyelids. From the subconscious mind, exciting the retina, signals will begin to flow, creating familiar phenomena – the appearance of luminous spots, geometric shapes, obscure objects, which are projected onto the inner screen. Focus on these images. Explore them. Internal contemplation will help to cope with the flow of thoughts.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nCombination of extended vision training with stopping internal dialogue exercises is one of the most effective. Focus your gaze (eyes should be wide open) on some distant object – the window of the building, the point on the wallpaper, the tree on the hill. The gaze is concentrated on a certain point of the object. At the same time, hold your breath and try not to let thoughts float in your mind. Take control of even the fleeting movement of thought, holding your sight and breathing. This practice helps to stop momentary dialogue and learn the technique of reflection. There is no perception of the world at the moment. At all. Your eyes just reflect the images of objects, not understanding them, not giving and characteristics. The world around you will stop, after which you can look at it in a new way.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nTo develop defocused gazing skill, you can practice it with closed eyes. Imagine mentally big screen, as if in a movie theater. Fix this image in your mind as clearly as possible. As soon as the picture is fixed and becomes as real as possible. Move your sight through it systematically or in a chaotic manner. Keep your eyes closed during the entire exercise.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nExercise to defocus and control thoughts. On a sheet of any format (preferably A4 or A3) draw a point with a diameter of two centimeters. Attach it to the wall and sit on a chair, moving it to 1-2 meters. Look at the point, without blinking or slightly squinting. At first, you’ll feel some discomfort, but gradually it will completely pass. Focus on the point. You should clearly see its edges. Soon you’ll notice a white halo around the point, after which it will begin to move around the sheet. Your task is to keep it in one place as long as possible. At this point, the flow of thoughts in your head will subside. After exercise, blink frequently, to relieve tension from your eyes.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nWorkout on defocused look. While sitting in the room, select one point and concentrate your gaze on it. With a side glance, “hook” another object that is located behind it or on its side. Keep a look at both points. Then with a defocused look, cover the entire room, all objects that are in it. Add one item or several items at once.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nSpread peripheral vision on all subjects, that you can cover. The breadth of coverage can be adjusted, but try to maximize it. The orientation of the look should be slightly above the horizon. Hold this state. Try to feel the flow of energy that passes through the body. After just a few minutes you’ll feel incredible ease. Exercise can be done in the morning. To be filled with positive for the whole day.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nLook at the window or door frame. At first glance is directed straight ahead, then it must be moved to the left edge of the frame, then to the right. Do the exercise several times. Now place the gaze in front of you again and spread it so as to look as if into the distance, “to nowhere”. You should keep both edges of the frame in sight. Hold your gaze as long as possible, trying not to think about anything. If there are objects behind the window or behind the door (they can be either moving or not), turn them into the picture of contemplation. Try to get the frames to the foreground, and what is in a straight line – to the back.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nWhile performing exercises related to the visual center, move a thumb over the pad of your index finger. Motility of the hands will block internal streams of thoughts.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nA very interesting method to cope with the internal pronunciation is the method of fear. For example, imagine that there is a monster behind the door or under the bed. Shock therapy will force the flow of thoughts simply to \"run away\".\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nWhile working, while reading, being in transport or at home, periodically keep the tip of the tongue in contact with the palate. The inner pronunciation will begin to disappear by itself.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nRespiratory practice. Take a full deep breath in your lower abdomen. Then exhale as completely as possible, so that it feels like there is no air left in the lungs. At that moment, when you held your breath before leaving, try to think about something important. You’ll notice, that thoughts stretch like rubber will seem incoherent. Exactly at this moment you should try to stop the stream of thought.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nRespiratory practice can act as a kind of preparation for a particular occupation. Stopping the internal dialogue, concentration meditation – everything related to mental activity. Start making frequent superficial sighs. During frequent shallow breathing, thoughts evaporate by themselves as the brain monitors respiratory activity. After a few seconds (don’t do this for a long time, so that hyperventilation does not occur), return to calm even breathing. The mental structure, therefore, is significantly shot down. Such a shake helps the body rebuild in a new way. The alternation of fast breaths becomes a kind of catalyst for changing the thinking process.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nWith the help of breathing practice, you can also increase the ability to control attention. To do this, sit down straight or lie down so that your arms and legs are not crossed. Start abdominal breathing, and then concentrate on the nasopharynx. You’ll begin to feel the cold of each breath and the warmth of the breath. Move the attention to the throat and go down to the rest of the body. Try to concentrate as much as possible on each part of the body. Muscles should be relaxed.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nFind a second-hand clock at home. Focus all the attention on how it moves around the dial. You’re most focused on the arrow. Thoughts at this time should be as repressed as possible. Repeat this for a few minutes, taking breaks after each lap of 60 seconds.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nTake any object in hand. Better small. For starters, you can choose a well-known thing as simple as possible. Take a good look at it. Then close your eyes and imagine it down to the smallest detail. Keep it clear in your mind as long as possible. Gradually increase the complexity of the external form. Then you can do this exercise with an open book, mentally reproducing each line.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nCreative visualization to help practice concentration and attention skills. Take a comfortable posture and relax. Now focus on the right hand wrist. Try to distract from external factors as much as possible. Feel all the processes that occur in the wrist, pass these sensations through consciousness. Move attention to the elbow, then forearm, chest, abdomen, thighs, up to the foot. Then go to the left side of the body. At that moment, when the body is completely enveloped, relax sharply and imagine that your body has disappeared. After reaching the disembodied state, start “sculpt your body”. Imagine, that you are a sculptor, focus on the right wrist and re-create it, fixing the slightest sensation. Do the second part of the exercise in the same order as the first. Alternate body parts until the process is fully absorbed. Now you can focus on both a separate part of the body and feel it as a whole.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nIt’s necessary to take three to four deep breaths and exhale. Eyes can either be closed or not. Listen to the ambient sounds and select three of them. It may be the sound of a ticking clock, dripping water, the breath of a person, but not the sounds associated with speech or words. Distinguish between them, select from the general noise and concentrate all your attention. Now hold your breath. There are only these sounds. No mental streams. If difficulty arises with holding your breath, you can just breathe deeply and evenly.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nMeditation related to contemplation. Very simple, but at the same time deep practice. As a rule, the slightest event occurring in our reality has an emotional response in our soul, followed by fixation in consciousness. Watching the processes taking place, move away from them. Imagine, that you are just watching TV. Abstracted from the movement of cars, boiling on the stove kettle, running past the cat. Don’t interfere in the surrounding world. Contemplate it as if it is not happening to you, but only reflected on the TV monitor.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nAttention and thought process are inseparable. Let us try to learn to focus attention, so that the extra flows don’t interrupt the process of contemplation. This technique is very useful for teaching speed reading – it teaches to keep attention on several objects at once. So stretch your arms in front of you and look at them. Try to use side vision to see both little fingers. Focus on these two points. Without leaving this state, study it, pay attention to your own feelings, completely eliminating the internal dialogue. As soon as the flow of thoughts resumed, it means that attention is lost. Start over. Train until the need for fingers disappears.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nBreathing exercises. Focus on your breathing. Take a comfortable posture and start tracking every breath. Don’t try to change the pace or control, delaying the process of breathing. Just kind of contemplate it. Feel your breath, both inside and out. This practice will help you in case of stressful situations or when you are excited.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nFor this exercise you’ll need two small things different in form and texture. Take them in hand. Go through them, feel with your fingers, stroke, study each component. At the same time as this action, focus on breathing and feel how the air enters the nostrils as you inhale and exhale.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nLook at the starry sky. Contemplating the stars, peering into the darkness of the night, tame the flow of thoughts. As soon as the internal dialogue is silenced under the weight of the universe, shut your eyes very tightly and transfer the image of the sky into the subconscious. If you manage for some time not to give in to the pressure of thoughts, a vacuum will form inside you, the work of the brain will stop. You’ll feel a new I inside you. Fix this feeling, stay in it. As soon as you open your eyes again, you will realize that the brain seems to have a reboot.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nIn order to tune in to exercise or reading (and this is important!) imagine, that a ray of light is arising in your heart region. Imagine, how it goes up through the occipital region. Give this visualization as much strength as possible. So you’ll feel, that with the flow bad thoughts disappear and lightness appears.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFor breathing exercises, I also recommend one exercise. Breathe smoothly and calmly. Calculate how long each breath lasts. Suppose you have spotted the number three. Next, do the following gymnastics: while breathing in, count to three → while holding your breath, count to three – while breathing out, count to three. Perform 10-15 cycles. Internal dialogue will pause, you will become calmer and more focused.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nDuring the passage of the simulators from the third part of the book, take breaks to rest. In order to gain strength, the technique of “relaxed head” will do. It is necessary to “release” the muscles of the face and head. Gradually, the voltage will begin to disappear, the folds on the forehead will be smoothed out. You’ll feel how your face, as if fallen, thoughts have ceased to disturb you. In everyday life, this skill is also useful. During the working day, relax not only the face and head, but smoothly go to the neck, chest, arms, gradually covering the whole body. If you suddenly think of extraneous things, and you want to say something, make a monotonous sound. The practice of “Om” meditation will free you from internal dialogue and help you concentrate.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nPretty simple exercise related to visualization. You can get rid of obsessive thoughts, if you imagine them in the form of soap bubbles. Mentally draw a beautiful soap bubble, imagine its color, size, the way it shimmers with colors in the sun. Put in it all annoying, unpleasant, small thoughts, fill it in full. Now let him go flying, watch his movement and watch him burst against the sky. These thoughts will not return to you.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nDuring reinforced practices related to brain training, it’s necessary to find time to rest. Choose four pieces of time per day, during which you can completely disconnect from any kind of activity for 10-15 minutes. For example, it may be ten o'clock in the morning, two in the afternoon, six and nine in the evening. Sit back, look at one point. If it happens at work, then draw a heavy mental work, just looking at the monitor. During this time, spend five minutes breathing. Breathe in the stomach, taking a deep breath and exhaling. As soon as outside thoughts begin to come to mind, transfer attention to the process of breathing. The first two weeks will not be easy to do this, but after you bring this procedure to automatism. For the next five minutes, practice a phased relaxation of your muscles. By analogy with the previous techniques, start with the head, moving gradually to the toes. Along with bodily relaxation, thoughts will begin to recede, as the brain, like the same muscle, will feel weakening impulses. Spend the last five minutes on the defocused gaze. Feel the inner body heat. Immerse yourself in a semi-meditative state. The gaze is dispersed, the body is relaxed, the breathing is even. After such exercises you will feel an unprecedented surge of strength, which will allow you to start working with even more enthusiasm.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThere is one Indian method that not only trains willpower, but also allows you to keep attention on internal sensations. I would call this exercise “Heron”. The point of exercise is that you need to stand on one leg, holding the other. It’s necessary to stand not for a couple of seconds, but for a few minutes. The \"trick\" is that balance can be maintained only by fully concentrating on the process. Any thought, emotion, or inner movement will cause you to sway and lose control of the body. Without swaying, you can stand only by completely disconnecting from your inner thoughts. This practice is a kind of metaphor for our whole life. Being engaged in speed reading and being distracted by external objects, we swing ourselves, not giving an opportunity to plunge into the process entirely. We spend our whole life “standing on one leg,” because uncontrollable emotions, feelings, fervor, haste, we tilt in different directions. Standing on one leg in complete rest for several minutes, we are aware of the importance of tireless concentration on inner experiences, the need to suppress unnecessary thoughts.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nExercise will be useful before starting speed reading with suppression of pronunciation. Imagine, that you can exhale thoughts with an exhalation. Imagine the quiet surface of the reservoir to free your mind and focus on your breathing. Each exhalation is a thought, that leaves your head. Exercise in this way you can anywhere.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nDuring a conversation with the interlocutor, try to listen only to his voice. Without thinking about the content of speech. Feel his voice, create a mental image. Then you can apologize and ask to repeat the information.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nWith the help of the account it’s possible not only to control the internal speaking during speed reading, but also the flow of thoughts. Count in mind from one to a hundred. As soon as the listing is interrupted by a sudden thought, stop and start over. If you were able to count up to two hundred, you have successfully mastered the technique.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThe previous exercise can be complicated. Start counting between one and one hundred, but making small pauses between numbers. If you are able to count to thirty, start combining the score with breathing exercises: inhale \/ exhale – one – inhale \/ exhale – two and so on until a hundred. As soon as an unexpected thought flashes, go back to the beginning of the process. The goal is to replace the internal dialogue. If you can easily go all the way, start training to stop the internal dialogue without the help of the count, only by effort of will.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nPractice learned from Zen Buddhism. Perform the exercise to stand up. Straight arms begin to make turns in different directions – draw a horizontal line with your right hand and a vertical line with your left hand. Then complicate the task – change hands, draw different shapes. The main thing – the simultaneity and continuity of movements. This technique is a bit more complicated than the one described above. The back should be straight. Thoughts of effort will be suppressed. More difficult level is drawing of the alphabet from A to Z. During workout, keep attention on even breathing.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nThe world around us seems to be familiar to the last detail. There is a technique that will accelerate the neural network and allow you to see familiar objects in a completely different light. So take a look at any familiar item. Let it be a kitchen table or cabinet. Imagine seeing it for the first time. Forget everything you know about it. Mentally remove from the baggage of knowledge the slightest idea of ​​it – what it is made of, what its components are called. Previous experience doesn’t matter. The cabinet is a rectangular object. It consists of boards. Try to dissuade yourself even from knowing that it’s a rectangle or a board. Dive into the subject, ignoring its external signs. Look at the object, but observe only its image, not tying any past knowledge about the most elementary things. Feel the object at the level of emotions – its color, shades, mass, texture, but not pronouncing these characteristics to yourself. If the task is done correctly, waking up from this state, you will see the whole beauty of the object, its uniqueness and originality.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nVery interesting exercise related to the training of neural systems. It consists in imposing sounds on objects uncharacteristic for them. For example, on the cat to apply the sound of a ticking clock, on the car – the crying of a child and so on to infinity. An experiment can be limited only by your imagination. Exercise with all the objects that fall into your area of ​​vision.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInternal dialogue often overshadows the world around us. New neural connections cannot form as the brain tends to rest. We are much nicer to see familiar objects, than to analyze new information. Remember your last trip. Getting into a strange city, we are so passionate about the contemplation of architecture, unfamiliar streets, other cultures, people, that the internal dialogue stops by itself. That’s why many psychologists advise to make as many trips as possible in order to stimulate the thinking process, to learn to discover the world. Try to carry out this process while in your hometown. Coming out of the house, notice the smallest details of the landscape – balconies, passers-by, the behavior of street cats and dogs, pigeons. Try to re-see the familiar world, analyzing the slightest incident. Little by little, you will begin to notice how the brain analyzes what is happening instead of “digging” in the usual thoughts.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nIn the past chapters, I have already mentioned how important it is to be able to be in the “here and now” moment. For this there is one very simple exercise. Sit in a comfortable position and relax as much as possible. Take a look around. What do you see? Take a closer look at the smallest details, pay attention to how you breathe, what sounds are heard in an apartment, office or on the street. Feel yourself in the moment of being. Listen to your feelings. Immerse yourself in this second, minute. Concentrated vigilance will help you become aware of yourself included in the common fabric of the world. This contemplative (in all senses) practice develops the ability to see in detail the reality framing our lives. If you learn to notice even the smallest details, not only confidence in the moment of being will develop, but also the ability to analyze these details and put them together. Hence, contrary to the conventional opinion about the innateness of this quality, the ability to use intuition appears.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nStraighten your arms. Make several rotational movements in the vertical plane with the right brush, i.e. down up. Now start doing the reverse actions with your left hand. It will be quite difficult to do this, but continue until it is possible to perform the opposite actions with both hands. In addition to stopping the internal dialogue, neural connections will be strengthened.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nVery interesting from the point of view of training the neural system exercise. Remember, I was talking about a fitness trainer who offered his students to study the body in order to learn how to walk, jump, run, in other words, move anew? This technique was practiced by Carlos Castaneda. He called her \"walking power.\" To do this, bend the knees a little, fix the arms at the waist and squeeze the hands into a fist. Go ahead, looking strictly at the horizon. Unusual style of walking frees from unnecessary thoughts and teaches us to move unusually in space, reminding us how automatic our actions are in everyday life.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nWe perform many actions by inertia. Mechanism of action leads to the fact that our brain \"rests\" in most of the time. From this, meaningless dialogue is born, which we scroll through in our head time after time. You can get rid of it if you start to perform familiar actions in an unusual way. Try to start writing with both hands, hold the mouse in your other hand, or brush your teeth using the other hand. At first, this will seem unusual, but the brain will begin to create new connections. As soon as the hand reaches out to perform the usual ritual, stop this moment. Walking along the street, start walking backwards, climbing stairs, alternate steps one or two. Just do not turn new habits into a routine, look for new ways to \"deceive\" the brain. The habit of methodical execution of actions will go the same way as all the rubbish from the head.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nTry during the execution of familiar actions to step back and look at your manipulations as if from the side. The state of \"observer\" will help to concentrate better during the day.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFinally, I would like to touch on a very important aspect – sticky thoughts. Most often, they \"attack\" us before bedtime. Surely, everyone faced with them – this is an incomplete dialogue, an insoluble dispute, mistakes of the past, unfulfilled relationships, unsuccessful interview – each has its own “fad”. They attack completely unexpectedly and at the wrong time, sometimes they are completely inappropriate. I found a kind of recipe for this problem. Choose the time during the day – in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening – it does not matter, the main thing is that you can fully devote it to yourself. Turn off all extraneous noisy devices, neither the radio nor the TV should distract you. Fully immerse yourself in the problem. Ponder it, savor, view from all sides, draw scripts. As soon as you feel that your thoughts are running the other way, return them to the given direction. Spend at least twenty minutes to this, you can even set a timer. Do it every day at one strictly certain time. The brain will remember. This procedure will go to the level of the reflex. Now, if a sticky thought “clings” to you during the day, the brain will know for sure that it has a fixed time to think about the problem. Over time, you will be so tired of spending 20 minutes on a meaningless return to the past, that this time you will spend with much higher efficiency.\n\n\nChapter 10. Comfortable reading: make ourselves comfortable\n\nEach physical activity, to which I also rank speed reading, requires not only the correct technical approach, but also depends largely on how comfortable the body feels at the time of exercise I would like to devote a separate chapter of this book to ergonomics, i.e. optimize the lessons themselves in terms of the physiology of the reader.\n\nImagine, that you came to a fitness club, where the coach tells you about the workouts needed to create the perfect figure. In addition to the description of the exercises themselves, he will certainly tell you how to stretch the muscles correctly, what you need to do if the body gets overloaded, how to eat properly to maintain strength. While learning speed reading, one should also pay attention to the general principles and laws of passing the methodology.\n\nCompliance with certain rules helps to exclude the possibility of obtaining undesirable consequences – deterioration of vision, headache.\n\nThe optimal distance from the eyes to the book\n\nOn the basis of the conclusion of oculists and physiologists, the distance at which the text should be from the eye level during reading – 30-40 centimeters is revealed. Most often this figure is concretized – 33 centimeters. It can also be calculated as follows – it should be no less than the length from the elbow to the fingertips. With the help of such a \"line\" you can always keep this distance under control. This distance should always work if you are reading while sitting at a table with a straight back.\n\nThere is a hidden meaning in this distance, since 30-40 centimeters is the range in which peripheral vision begins to work. While reading the information, the view simply needs space in order not to snatch one word from the text, but to be able to cover it entirely. If you bring a book or tablet too close to the eyes, lateral vision simply cannot reveal its potential. In addition, the minimum distance leads to eye strain, as a result of which the vision may deteriorate.\n\nDuring the reading process, we engage the optic nerves and brain, which are closely connected with other organs of our body.\n\nCorrect posture when reading\n\nDuring the reading, try to follow the posture. Back should be straight, so that the organs don’t pinch and the brain receives enough oxygen. In addition, the brain, constantly monitoring the position of the body, won’t be distracted by foreign objects.\n\nThe best position for reading is standing and sitting. Brain activity increases. I noticed, that when I read standing up, I concentrate more on the text, the extra streams of thoughts disappear from my head. If you feel, that the body is too tense, you can take a slightly relaxed posture, but only for a short period of time. Of course, the most comfortable position is sitting, but try using the vertical position to feel the difference.\n\nThe most heated debate is the question of whether it is possible to engage in speed reading while lying. I absolutely do not recommend it. In the floor, lying down, we cease to control internal processes, the brain begins to relax and fall asleep. That creates the moment of deconcentrating, which often leads to regressions. Another reason not to read while lying is tension on the cervical vertebrae. If the head rests on the pillow, the neck gets excessive tension and starts to hurt. And, finally, a distance of 30 centimeters in the prone position is almost impossible to observe, and therefore peripheral vision suffers. This implies a total inefficiency in the exercises in the supine position.\n\nIn childhood, we often liked to lie on the grass or on the couch, reading adventure novels. Often this wondrous process was interrupted by my mother's remarks: “Don’t read lying down – you’ll hurts your eyesight!” If the children's conviction that there is nothing wrong with lying and my previous words have not convinced you, I’ll cite a few more facts.\n\nFirstly, this habit is harmful and in its consequences is as destructive as any other habit that destroys the body.\n\nSecondly, in the prone position, the chest is squeezed, causing oxygen to enter the brain poorly.  Just think that it’s so important to follow the rhythm of breathing during exercise! The horizontal position doesn’t allow the body to balance the process of inhalation and exhalation, so attention and concentration will suffer from this.\n\nThirdly, blood circulation is hampered, which can cause stagnation in the cerebral cortex. They lead to a constant headache. They are concentrated mainly in the occipital region.\n\nChange the position of sitting-standing while doing speed reading. If you feel, that your body start to get used to these poses, change the place of dislocation. You can walk around the room with a book. Your body at rest doesn’t contribute to attentive reading as periodic physical activity does.\n\nYou should remove eyestrain that the visual system receives during the exercise. In order for the eyes not to be injured from overwork, I recommend turning to a special gymnastics.\n\nSupportive eye gymnastics\n\nIt is recommended to be engaged for 10-15 minutes in the morning and in the evening. You can do the exercises, both in the middle of training and after it.\n\nClose your eyes tightly, count to three and open wide. It is necessary to repeat 5-6 times with a break of 30 seconds.\n\nWithout turning your head, move your eyes up and down, left and right. Repeat 5-6 times with an interval of 30 seconds.\n\nTurn your eyes in a rotational motion first clockwise. Then – against. You can do the exercise, with both open and closed eyes. Repeat 5-6 times with an interval of 30 seconds.\n\nBlink quickly in one minute. This exercise will improve blood circulation and quickly relieve fatigue.\n\nClose your eyes and slowly, gently touching the eyelids with your fingers, massage them. Make circular smooth movements clockwise and back. After one minute of this relaxation, you will feel how your eyes become fresh and vigorous.\n\nAll previous exercises are recommended to do sitting with a straightened back.\n\nExercise is performed while standing. Look straight ahead for two to three seconds. Then stretch your index finger 25-30 centimeters from your eyes. Translate your gaze to your fingertip and hold it for five seconds. Then lower your hand for a couple of seconds and start the exercise again. The cycle is at least ten times. This technique reduces fatigue and is extremely useful when working with texts at close range.\n\nIn order to keep your eyesight healthy for many years, it’s enough to remember five simple rules:\n\nTry to reduce being near the TV or monitor. If your job is connected with a permanent sitting at the computer. Get special glasses and do gymnastics for sight more often.\n\nRead within 30 minutes, and after that you must take breaks. Take a break from a book or magazine and walk around the room. So you not only give your eyes a rest, but you can “digest” the information.\n\nDo not read while lying down and with a little light – the eyes will quickly tire. Observe the golden rule of 30 centimeters.\n\nGive your body physical exertion. It’s proved, that sport contributes to the development of not only mental abilities, but also the training of vision. During morning jogging, playing tennis, football or basketball, peripheral vision develops.\n\nBe sure to check your eyesight every year. If you notice, that your vision has begun to fall, you can prevent and correct the fatal consequences for the eyes.\n\nIn addition to eye health, I also thought about the problem that we face quite often. It lies in the fact that some of the activities take away a lot of energy from us – after performing these or other tasks, we feel exhausted.\n\nEnergy to read\n\nImagine, that on your way home from work you are anticipating how to plunge into the world of an exciting detective story, how you will, with the Belgian detective, unravel the tangle of crimes. But it also happens, that unfinished work can wait at home when you need to view and structure whole canvases of complex and confusing text – a situation like this only takes a fair amount of energy at the thought of it.\n\nWhat to do in this situation?\n\nAdditional feed required. The easiest way to do this is through physical exercises that contribute to the production of endorphins – the so-called. hormones of joy. When I face a difficult task or have a sleepless night with a lot of textual information, I start to squat.\n\nThis trick was prompted to me by my acquaintances, students of the medical university. Before a difficult exam, when you need to repeat a lot of material a day, they accelerated blood circulation through various exercises. During classes, drowsiness disappeared, the brain was saturated with oxygen. Therefore, the learning process was more productive.\n\nDuring the reading every hour and a half, take breaks of five minutes to perform squats or pushups. You can do the following exercise. Put your palms together and begin to rub them as if you are washing your hands or rubbing the snow. Do you feel the appearance of warmth? Fine. Now shake one hand with the other as if you were greeting yourself. This simple technique will help to distract for a short time and saturate the body with energy.\n\nBe sure to switch during hard work. For more than an hour. You will feel strong pressure in the temporal lobe and on the eye nerves, so reduce the time to 30 minutes between intervals. Stretch, knead the spine, perform finger exercises. The brain will respond to body movement and react as if it were a ringing alarm clock.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nIf you want to have external beauty, train your body, if you want internal, train your brain, but if you want to become a harmoniously developed person, train both.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPart III. Simulators\n\nYou and me have come a long way. If you are reading these lines, it means that I coped with my task – I carried my reader on a courageous adventure of reprogramming thinking to improve my skills of concentration, attention and memory. All this brings us to the methodical passage of special simulators, allowing to develop the speed of reading from 100 pages in 1 minute to infinity.\n\nSystematic exercise with simulators will increase the reading speed by 5-10 times. After several years of learning this skill, I can read a rather extensive text stuck in a traffic jam. If earlier I took on the book with a certain degree of doom, because I didn’t know if I would be able to finish it because of employment, now even the weightiest volume does not frighten me with its size.\n\nThe most important aspects of speed reading are perception, understanding, memorization and reproduction. It’s not enough to read the page in five seconds, it is important to comprehend and assimilate the information received. This requires performing the exercises in a disciplined manner, but without overwork. I recommend practicing at least 1 hour a day, preferably 2 hours a day, ideally 3 hours a day. Don’t forget, that classes should be regular. If at first you will feel some discomfort associated with reluctance and fatigue, then after a few weeks you will be so involved in the process that it will become an integral part of your daily rhythm. This system will allow you to feel the difference in perception in a month!\n\nThe main principle of training is to start here and now. Don’t postpone in the basket of time business, that can turn your life around. I tried to make the simulators not only simple, but also fascinating, so that after the working day they would not turn into a severe test, but would turn into a great pastime. Many of the exercises will help relieve tension, reduce eye pressure, rest the optic nerves.\n\nIn addition to practicing, I recommend reinforcing reading skills. Choose a variety of literature to diversify leisure and replenish the stock of knowledge: scientific and specialized journals, art works, educational materials, notes and essays, your diaries, entertainment portals, news, working correspondence and reports. After reading a few pages, stop. Rate the time it took to read. Summarize the content. Remember the names, terms, surnames, or dates that appear in the text. So you can track the dynamics of learning.\n\nBefore you begin to perform the exercises, identify the main problem that prevents you from mastering the speed reading technique. To do this, answer the following questions:\n\nCan I control the internal dialogue and articulation?\n\nIs it difficult for me to focus on one action? Where are my thoughts?\n\nHow easily do I perceive typed text?\n\nCan I remember what I read?\n\nWhat would I like to change in the method of reading?\n\nAnswers to these questions will help to recognize your strengths and weaknesses. If some simulators are given to you easily, and others – with great difficulty, focus your attention on the latter, fixing the results already available.\n\nTry to record the achieved level to track the dynamics. Don’t limit yourself to speed reading, watch the level of perception in your daily, work environment. Observe how much professional productivity has increased. Involve your environment in training – remember the reported facts, try to understand what is being said, ask as many questions as possible.\n\nWhen working with simulators, use the experience gained through the second part of the book. If at first some of the practices will be difficult to combine, do not despair – remember the habit, which is formed only with time. Felt that fatigue takes over and motivation disappears? Refer to the first section, re-read those thoughts that inspired you to read speed intellectual mountaineering. A set of techniques collected in one manual will replace high-paying courses and save you a lot of time.\n\nForward to the unconquered peaks!\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can”, Arthur Ashe\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nChapter 14. Neural Games\n\nNeural Accelerator\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nThis exercise is absolutely unique – its development is the starting point in the field of training of neural connections and acceleration of brain activity. Brain fitness specialist Henry Munk expressed in the following way: “The main goal of the brain is to solve the problem. He constantly moves from small details to the overall picture and back. When the brain works to assemble the big picture together, it undergoes a neuroplasticity transformation.” During the transformation of the brain (namely, in this area focused research company Posit Science, which is headed by Munk) new neural connections are formed. According to scientists, improving the speed and accuracy of information processing is closely related to the training of the visual system.\n\nThis training is aimed at the development of peripheral vision, which is very useful for the aspect that is so necessary for speed reading as an extension of the visual field. At the same time, you learn to concentrate by focusing on the center of the image. In addition, the higher the speed of the simulator, the less time is left for pronouncing words, so you will also start to get rid of this destructive habit for speed reading.\n\nInstructions.\n\nFirst, a series of words appears on the screen, where each of the subsequent ones is highlighted with a marker. Your task is to read these words in a defocused way, avoiding mental articulation. The display speed can be controlled manually to improve the skill. Difficulty levels are different – a series of words turns into columns, words flash on the screen in a scattered format, and finally, words appear in blocks. The simulator is interactive. Having mastered the initial level, fix the result and move on.\n\nRecommendation. It’s necessary to pass the simulator in a completely relaxed state. Throw away extra thoughts, take a comfortable posture. Having reached a meditative state, concentrate all your attention on the screen, concentrating your eyes on its middle. Your peripheral vision will begin processing information, thereby strengthening the neural connections of the brain, making them more plastic.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“We are all now connected by the Internet, like neurons in a giant brain”, Stephen Hawking\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nSchulte table\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nThis course of exercises is basic in many speed reading guides. I couldn’t avoid it, because it really works and helps to advance in the field of preparation for mastering the skill to which this book is devoted. The development of peripheral (side) vision is one of the most important components of speed reading. Speed of the process increases due to the fact that the glance doesn’t single out a few letters, but covers the entire word or string.\n\nWith the help of tables, after 3 weeks an improvement in the properties of memory and attention is noted. It’s important not only for mastering quick reading, but also for other fields of activity. Many of those who deal with tables advise to contact this simulator in moments of creative and intellectual crisis. By focusing on numbers and opening the boundaries of perception, the solution is found with ease.\n\nInstructions.\n\nSchulte's tables appeared in the middle of the last century as psychodiagnostic methods for studying the properties of attention. Each table is a field with random numbers. The Schulte table is a square containing from 25 cells, where the numbers from 1 to 25 are located in disorder. Before the beginning of the lesson, you need to fix the look in the center of the table, and the side one to cover the whole field. It is required to quickly arrange the numbers in order, without moving the gaze and avoid moving the gaze horizontally. Speed ​​should be increased gradually to achieve the desired result.\n\nFor more effective classes it is recommended to take a comfortable posture, relax and tune in to work. The distance from the eyes to the table should be 30-35 cm (as in reading). It should be remembered that the entire lesson takes place in a blurred spectrum of vision with a minimal movement of the eye and not speaking numbers to himself. Keep track of missing passes. If the number is not found, continue to search.\n\nIt is advisable to study twice a day – in the morning and in the evening, however, if you feel overworked, go to another exercise in order not to strain the muscles of the eye. As you master the levels and consolidate the skill, go to the tables with a large number of cells – 6 * 7, 6 * 10.\n\nProceed slowly, no one requires a lightning-fast result from you. Skills develop gradually, but at some point you will notice a clear progress! After that, properly consolidate the experience and transform it into a habit, then increase the intensity of training.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year”, Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nAccelerated reading\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nExercise related to the speed of perception of visual information. Why is speed important? Reducing the time of reception \"accelerates\" the neurons of the brain, spurs it to increase the processing speed of what he saw. If you have difficulties with passing speed tasks, try to relax with the help of meditative techniques. Imagine, that high speed does not affect whether or not you can cope with the simulator. Consider swiftness, as an opportunity to improve concentration and expand the field of view for the most effective mastering of speed reading. In addition, the simulator significantly helps to improve visual memory.\n\nInstructions.\n\nWords will appear on the screen in an accelerated mode. The task is to fix the gaze on the center of the screen while maintaining the visual coverage of the entire canvas. Do not read the words and text, remember only the image of the word. Remember the last word that appears and click on the button with the correct option. The main thing is that the concentration during the passage of the exercise was maximum.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything”, George Bernard Shaw\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nMath tasks\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nSurely, you may wonder, for what reason among the exercises collected so many tasks related to numbers. I tried to collect techniques that cover all areas of brain activity.\n\nFrom conversations with familiar philologists, who seemed so far from the exact sciences, I concluded, that the language system and mathematics are very closely related. Language and numeric coding have a clear logical structure; they form a system with clear system connections. With logical thinking, you can acquire the skill of information processing at the highest level.\n\nIn Japanese culture, there is such a thing as \"mental arithmetic.\" It focuses on performing numerical operations (including multiplication and division) using the oral counting method. This practice allows students from school to train the right hemisphere and develop its unlimited possibilities. For those who do not like math, I advise you to treat this simulator as a way to use those areas of the brain that contribute to the study of speed reading – attentiveness, concentration, analysis. Gradually, the numbers will no longer appear to you as “strangers,” which, even at the level of everyday life, will improve the skills of perceiving digital information.\n\nInstructions.\n\nYou are offered math problems that you should solve as correctly as possible. You can choose the optimal level of difficulty, trying to move from easier tasks to the most difficult ones. The speed of passage is also provided to choose from.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things”, Henri Poincare\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nColor confusion\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nDifferent hemispheres of the brain are responsible for perceptions of the test and colors: the left processes information, and the right forms associative links with the color characteristics of the object. To strengthen and develop neural connections, I propose the Color confusion simulator. It helps improve perception and concentration skills. Being engaged in this simulator, use the experience on the defocusing of sight together with the ability to concentrate on the visual row.\n\nInstructions.\n\nWords denoting a particular color are written in a completely different color. Choosing the answer, you must specify not the color of the letter, but the color that is indicated by the word. Example:\n\nGreen – orange\n\nOrange – green\n\nThe higher the speed of the simulator, the better. Try to reduce the time spent finding matches each time.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Human behavior flows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and knowledge”, Plato\n\n\nUpside down\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nLearn to look at the world differently. Every day we pass through the jungle beaten with action, stereotypes and inertial movements. The usual world should sometimes be shaken to force the brain to re-evaluate the information environment. I would also refer this type of training to neuroplasticity gymnastics, contributing to the renewal of the field of perception. I will give an example from the cinema. In “Dead Poets Society” the main character – Professor of literature – asks students to stand at the teaching desk and look at the class from an unusual point of view. Try to do the same – stand on a chair, look around the room. Have you ever seen it like this? What has changed in it? And inside you? Changing a familiar picture of the world is very useful, especially at the stage of learning a new material or ability.\n\nInstructions.\n\nIn stream mode, the text is shown without turning from the beginning of the file to the end. However, the text is upside down. Choose an acceptable speed and read the text out loud or silently. Be sure to delve into the meaning of what you read in order to better understand the content. After 15 minutes, stop. Think about the impressions and try to retell the content of the story or essay.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Just when you think you know something, you have to look at in another way. Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try’, Dead Poets Society\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nMixed letters\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nTraining is related to understanding the meaning of the read without taking into account the external design. Our brain was initially programmed to “recognize” the words, their image, rather than read. This simulator will help to cope with the pronunciation, since the words placed in the text do not have your usual shell. At first, it will be quite difficult to get used to such a reading mode, but over time you will notice that the need for a full, full text disappears, and understanding does not suffer from this.\n\nInstructions.\n\nThe text can be read both in the automatic scrolling mode and in the manual control mode. Pages do not turn over – the text smoothly goes from the beginning of the file to the end. Depending on the difficulty level, the letters in the words will be confused. Your task is to read the text at a comfortable speed, understanding the content and meaning. It is not necessary to grasp each word and letter; some words can be omitted.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n“Thought is the wind, knowledge the sail, and mankind the vessel”, Augustus Hare\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nChapter 14. Attention!\n\nFocusing attention\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nVery simple simulator, that will teach you to concentrate on the object as much as possible. It’s useful and very effective for the technique of mastering speed reading, because at the expense of maximum concentration in the picture extraneous thoughts disappear and the internal dialogue disappears.\n\nHere I would like to give an analogy. There is such an exercise, the essence of which is reduced to standing for 10 minutes with a perfectly flat back and arms raised perpendicular to the body. At first, this seems to be an easy task, but the problem does not arise when the muscles of the arms begin to strain and get tired, but at the moment when the body gives provocative distracting signals – you want to scratch your nose or back. Our brain, a living organism, also creates such traps and tries to distract from the task of concentration. Try to ignore these “scratching.” To do this, refer to the meditative practices of breathing and stopping the inner dialogue.\n\nInstructions.\n\nIn the figure of the green lines, there is a pattern that depicts either a vase or two profiles facing each other. Focus as much as possible on the green contour. Think only about it. Switch from a vase image to face profiles, but do NOT get distracted by third-party thoughts.\n\nFelt that thoughts have gone far, and you already make a shopping list for tomorrow? With an effort of will, return to the exercise and start again until you feel that, in addition to the picture, the brain does not perceive any other background information. It is recommended to perform within 10-15 minutes.\n\nTip! Before starting your training, make sure that not only around, but also inside you there is peace. Tune in and gather with the help of meditative techniques – breathe, close your eyes, take a comfortable posture. Discard disturbing thoughts to get the most out of contemplation.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“The difference between something good and something great is attention to detail”,  Charles R. Swindoll\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nField of View\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nVery useful exercise for expanding the field of view. The ability to concentrate while using peripheral vision, boosted to the maximum, is the key to success for speed reading. In addition, the brain learns to perceive information in a compressed form in a short time frame. This skill is also useful in everyday life – you catch the slightest changes in the surrounding information environment and train the reaction to what is happening around.\n\nInstructions.\n\nIn front of you there is an incoherent text of the letters with gaps around the edges. Your task is to focus the view in the center, visually covering the entire table as a whole. Four identical letters will appear at the edges and at the moment when one of them is different, you should press the “Error” button. Fix inconsistencies, not trying to reproduce the letters shown to yourself. If you didn’t have time to press the “Error” button, that's okay, the main thing is that the discrepancy be fixed by sight. The instantaneous motor response is not as important for this exercise as the ability to focus.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“The moment one gives close attention to any thing, even a blade of grass it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself”, Henry Miller\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nWord’s Pairs\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nExercise is associated with improved concentration, and also helps improve the accuracy of remembering information. Training teaches not to pronounce words, eliminates articulation due to the fact that the word must be perceived as a whole.\n\nInstructions.\n\nOn each page you need to find five mismatched pairs of words that can be similar in spelling. You can move in any convenient order – in rows or columns. Try to increase the speed of finding inconsistencies, while remaining in a relaxed state. At the beginning of training on the simulator, you may feel the desire to read a word in order to see an error, however, with the right concentration and concentration, you will gradually get rid of the need to spell the word.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“As long as you keep going, you'll keep getting better. And as you get better, you gain more confidence. That alone is success”, Tamara Taylor\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nEven Numbers\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nExercise forces to concentrate on the exact reproduction of the image. Alternating the finding of words and numbers will teach to perceive the text as a single set of characters that have a particular meaning. Gradually memorizing numerical values ​​will become much easier. By developing the right hemisphere associated with mathematics and logic, you enable your perception to improve your analytical skills.\n\nInstructions.\n\nAmong the large amount of numbers, you need to find 6 even. You can move from line to line or columns, the mode should be convenient for you. During the passage of the simulator, try to relax as much as possible and at first do not pay attention to the speed. When you master the principle of search, reduce the time so that the brain adapts to the new speed of perception.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success”, Joyce Brothers\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nReading without Vowels\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nThe exercise is aimed at studying the content of the text – its internal core. During classes, you can notice how redundant texts are, how much extra information you have to study, before you get to the point. Of course, this does not apply to beautiful works of art, unless it recounts the list of ships in Homer or a detailed description in Jane Austen’s novel. This training helps, at the level of information perception, to cut off unnecessary things, not to pronounce unnecessarily long words and phrases.\n\nInstructions.\n\nThe mode reproduces the text in the automatic stream in the absence of page turning. The text moves from the beginning of the file (whether it is a book or an article) to the very end. Depending on the complexity chosen, there will be omissions of a certain number of vowels in the text. Read the text in a convenient mode for you with a comfortable speed. It is not necessary to read into each word, even if you have to skip part of the words. Yes, you cannot understand some words, but the general meaning of the text will not be lost from this. This fact indicates the redundancy of the text in the information plan.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“A great book begins with an idea; a great life, with a determination”, Louis L'Amour\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nChapter 14. I remember!\n\nConcentration\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nOne of the most effective simulators, covering the development of several skills at once: concentration, attention, visual field and memory. This exercise helps to keep a specific task in focus, which is necessary to achieve mastery of effective speed reading. For a short period, the brain learns to highlight the most important and remember the information received. Visual reaction improves significantly just after systematic training for several weeks!\n\nInstructions.\n\nOn the screen you’ll see flying circles of two colors – gray and blue. Concentrate extremely on the circles of blue – after stopping and setting all the circles in the same color, you need to select the balls that are filled with this particular color. The difficulty level can be chosen independently. Try to constantly increase the difficulty of the task and the time it takes to increase brain activity.\n\nIn close conjunction with this simulator is training for concentration-deconcentration. By increasing the field of view (defocusing), you may have noticed that the mind falls into an almost meditative state: a scattered look, a fixed pupil, the mind tries to capture the whole picture. Meditative and trance states, as already mentioned in Part II of the book, significantly increase the depth of information perception. They help to establish communication with the subconscious and enter the \"photo reading\" mode, when one glance at the page allows you to select the most important parts of the text. For a more effective passage of this simulator, try to look deep into the picture, noting with side vision how objects are moving.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Success in life is founded upon attention to the small things rather than to the large things; to the everyday things nearest to us rather than to the things that are remote and uncommon”, Booker T. Washington\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nRemember Number\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nImproves skills to expand the field of view in the horizontal peripheral sphere. It’s useful both for reducing the time of fixation, and for quick memorization of the information received. The simulator can be used not only as an auxiliary tool for teaching speed reading, but also for other areas – the instantaneous assimilation of exact facts, the rapid assimilation of heavy material containing a large amount of numbers, dates, terms, surnames and names.\n\nInstructions.\n\nThe numbers seen on the screen must be fixed on the keyboard. Think of numbers not separately, but as a single image. Do not pronounce the number to yourself. Reduce set time to a minimum. Try not to keep unnecessary thoughts in your head, focusing on the passage of the task.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Without memory, there is no culture. Without memory, there would be no civilization, no society, no future”, Elie Wiesel\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nMemorization of words\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nExercise to expand the field of view. It allows you to learn how to memorize text in large fragments at the most effective level of reading comprehension. The simulator develops a photographic memory on a mechanical level, so the brain will try to memorize words not on the associative-emotional tier of perception. Due to this, the training eliminates the internal pronunciation of words.\n\nInstructions.\n\nReplace the words and numbers on the page on the keyboard. Try to capture as much of the text as possible with one fixation of the gaze and fix it with the movements of your fingers. Photograph the text, without focusing on individual points and not pronouncing it to yourself. Reduce the time of training to the minimum. The simulator adjusts to your speed level. The limitation on the duration of the show will teach to reduce fixation when reading.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Own only what you can always carry with you: know languages, know countries, know people.

All the secondary he leaves as \"for later.\" This is the selective ability of our thinking. The simulator's task is to change the text perception program itself – to contain the largest amount of semantic information in a unit of time. Thus, regular classes will contribute to the ability to quickly analyze the text without internal pronunciation, but with a clear awareness of the read. In order for the experience gained through this program to be the most effective, use the techniques associated with the analysis.\n\nInstructions.\n\nThe program allows you to read text in the stream using the automatic mode. The bottom line is that the text moves across the screen in scroll mode, and not by turning the pages. The text moves normally from the beginning of the file to the end, but the speed is constantly changing. The speed of scrolling is higher than the standard one, so the brain learns to “catch up” with the content in order to prevent articulation. Gradually you will learn to read at a new rate, increasing the intensity of the scroll.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“The best advice I ever got was that knowledge is power and to keep reading”, David Bailey\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n3D Reading\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nReading mode allows you to get rid of the pronunciation of the text to which we are accustomed while still in school. Articulation significantly reduces the speed of reading due to a strong emotional binding to the content. Adjusting the speed of reading thanks to this simulator, you can catch not only the speech of the author, creating images in his head, as his thought.\n\nMoreover, this simulator is designed as a gym for the eyes. It allows you to reduce the load on the eyes and have a healing effect due to the fact that the visual axes are directed directly and in parallel (as if you were looking at the horizon). This allows the visual muscles to relax and get the necessary rest at the end of the day.\n\nDue to the fact that this reading mode allows you to separate the eye axis, the coverage of the text fragments increases, and the field of view increases. Reading a large text is also recommended for people with poor eyesight for training both eyes.\n\nInstructions.\n\nThe mode, presented in the form of a simulator, makes it possible to read any text using automatic page turning. Reading the text is necessary defocused view, training the ability to cover large chunks of text.\n\nThe principle of \"stereo reading\" is borrowed from a similar method of viewing pictures – you need to relax your eyes and cover three images entirely. Focus your eyes on the center to see the picture. At that moment, when the eye muscles relax as much as possible, the eye will focus on the image.\n\nThe initial level of training does not imply a complete understanding and memorization of the text, the main thing is to expand the field of view and get rid of articulation. Gradually increase the text feed rate, so that the brain gradually adapts to the lack of participation of the speech apparatus in the process and processing. The higher the rate of receipt of information, the faster the information will flow through the visual analyzer directly into the brain.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“The beauty of reading is that it lets you travel in a way you could never know”, Alek Wek\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nReading Field\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nIn fact, this training is aimed at expanding the field of view, but I would recommend also applying the techniques that were presented in the second chapter. Defocusing in conjunction with text analysis and memorization techniques will allow a much deeper penetration into the speed reading technique.\n\nInstructions.\n\nThe mode offers text reading by automatic page turning. In this case, a certain amount of text is highlighted in the preview window. It’s necessary to read with a defocused look, trying to cover as much text information as possible. At the initial stage, a complete understanding is quite difficult to achieve, so you should not overload your eyesight and brain, but in the future it is recommended to pay attention to what you read.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere”, Albert Einstein\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nGetting Rid of Speaking Text\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nThis method is aimed at combating articulation. With the help of the simulator, getting rid of it’s quite problematic, but after a few weeks of training, you can put it down.\n\nInstructions.\n\nThe text scrolls in line mode without turning. Read should defocusing eyes, avoiding horizontal movement of the eyes. Full reading comprehension is not required. The main thing is to consolidate the reading skill without articulation. Try to capture as much of the text field as possible. The most important thing is to tap the rhythm in the process of reading, no matter what, with your finger, pencil or foot. Rhythm is considered the most loyal ally in the fight against pronouncing. Watch your breathing – it should be smooth and smooth.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it”, Michelangelo\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nShooting Reading\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nA reading mode that helps both master and consolidate the ability to read using peripheral vision. I would recommend using this type of exercise at the end of daily workouts.\n\nWhat’s the profit?\n\nThis mode allows you to read text using automatic page turning. Try to read not individual words, but cover the maximum amount of text with a defocused look. At the initial stage of the simulator, a complete understanding of the meaning of the text is not required.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n“Fortune favors the prepared mind”, Louis Pasteur\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nTraining Recommendations \n\nI deliberately broke up the simulators into blocks dedicated to one or another skill:\n\n• Strengthen the blood flow in the frontal lobes, create new neural connections, expand the field of perception, the ability to analyze the information received;\n\n• Develop the ability to concentrate attention – to make a qualitative selection of the primary information and ignoring the secondary; the ability to quickly switch attention or keep the selected object in focus;\n\n• Improve all types of memory: arbitrary, instant, short-term, long-term, visual, auditory, mixed, etc.\n\nTraining should be engaged in the blocks. For example:\n\n\"Table Schulte\": 10-15 times per approach;\n\n“Remember the number”: from 5 times per approach;\n\n\"Field of view\": from 5 times per approach;\n\n\"Reading speed\": from 5 times per approach.\n\nNext, we proceed to reading of previously downloaded electronic books. With the help of the developed “readers” (“Accelerated reading”, “Reading with sighting”), it is necessary to read from 15 to 20 minutes per approach.\n\nEvery day is recommended to practice:\n\nIn the morning: 30 minutes of simulators, then 30-40 minutes for reading modes (15-20 each);\n\nIn the evening: 30 minutes of simulators, then 30-40 minutes for reading modes (15-20 for each).\n\nIf time and effort allow, you can increase the workload, but this should be done only if the eyes and the brain do not feel tired. I also advise you to read the literature that you like – fantasy, articles, news in the world of technology, in order to get real pleasure from the acquired skills.\n\nChapter 16. Top Secrets\n\nI specially placed this part of the book at the end in order not to test my reader’s strength. Impatience in conjunction with a tempting offer can play a cruel joke if a person is at the beginning. This chapter is the quintessence of all the described methods and simulators. After reading and learning several exercises, the speed of your reading will increase after 20 minutes of training! Having a knowledge base in the form of the ability to separate the most important from the secondary, to concentrate on the text in the right way and memorizing important facts, to increase the indicators dozens of times will not be difficult.\n\nReady? Then let's go!\n\nFewer stops\n\nWhile reading the text, the eyes don’t smoothly slide along the lines, but make a kind of jumps. The end of the jump is indicated by fixing attention on a certain part of the text. Most often, this segment is a quarter of a page. At the time of stopping, a visual image of the read text is performed.\n\nImagine the highway with rushing cars. Feel the car picking up speed and accelerate to one hundred kilometers per hour! As objects rush past, as the road glides under the wheels! Now imagine the city traffic with a lot of crossings and traffic lights – the car barely picks up speed, as it has to be slowed down due to restrictions. From this ride does not seem so free and smooth.\n\nThe same thing happens with ordinary reading. Just imagine, that you spend from ¼ to ½ second for each fixation. Now calculate the temporal passage at which your stops cost you if you read Hemingway’s novel?\n\nIn order to feel this process on yourself, close one eye with your fingertip, and slowly slide along the lines. The horizontal line of the text slows down significantly, like a conveyor belt moving in spurts.\n\nDo not come back\n\nRegression in the process of reading takes up to 30% of precious time in the process. Return to reading can be both conscious and unconscious in nature. If the reversion occurs unconsciously, then the subconscious self regains a glance at the place where control over attention was lost.\n\nConcentrate\n\nThanks to the lessons on concentration, the transition from medium to high rate reading speed will be realized much faster. This will help not only the use of the central focus, but also horizontal peripheral vision. Thus, the concentration of perceived words increases in one leap of view.\n\nDivide and rule\n\nStarting a workout, arrange classes in categories, not mixing them. For example, if you want to increase the speed of reading up to 300-400 words per minute, do not strive to assimilate the text one hundred percent, first master the technique of the expanded field of view, and then proceed to the exercises for attention and analysis. Perception reflexes should be maximized, so that later you are not distracted by adapting to an increased pace.\n\nDuring the course, you must go through three stages: understanding the principles of technology → application of the studied technology in practice → fast reading at the level of text understanding. Constantly increase the speed of the text in the \"readers\" to develop addictive to automatism.\n\nExtend the field of view\n\nYou shouldn’t concentrate on one word, if you can see the whole page (personally, I use this postulate as a motto for my own life). The wider the viewing angle, the higher the reading speed. Train your peripheral vision to increase your pace by 300, 500, 1000 times! Remember, that if you snatch only one word from the text, ignoring its surroundings, the speed drops by more than 25%. It turns out, that only a small part of the capabilities of the visual apparatus is involved in the process of slow reading, i.e. the efficiency of reading is reduced by almost half.\n\nImagine, that the text, revealed before you, is a rope ladder, where the steps are the words located along the vertical of the text. Rely on the words-steps with a direct look, but don’t lose the ropes themselves from the side view. By the same analogy, exclude the so-called \"empty fields\", i.e. avoid unnecessary eye movements – start reading the sentence from the third word and finish last. At first, the meaning of the text will completely elude you, but with each article or book you read, you will see how the black lines make sense.\n\n“Think about the meaning, and the words will come themselves,” said the fabulous Lewis Carroll’s heroine. All the words are already in your head, project your knowledge on the text, and you will see how an endless ocean of subtexts, wordplay, metaphors, which previously eluded, are revealed before you.\n\nDown with tricks\n\nYes, our brain is full of surprises. For example, reading our whole life as we were taught in school, we had no idea that a direct look is not the only reading tool. Our peripheral vision helps to see the entire text, covering entire paragraphs.\n\nA defocused look (not scattered, meaningless), as if by a lasso, “catches” that amount of information that is impossible with a slow reading of a direct direction. Using the techniques given in the book, you’ll be able to master the defocus technique and see the world in a completely new way.\n\nHaving defeated the attitudes that were initially laid in you, “having reprogrammed” the whole way of thinking, you can get immeasurable pleasure from the reading process, and re-experience the taste for knowledge.\n\nTurning off the internal dialog\n\nPronunciation, articulation, inner monologue or dialogue – all this prevents quality speed reading. Exercises related to meditation and concentration will help remove all the “rubbish” from the thinking process, so that an endless uncontrolled flow of thoughts does not “interrupt” the waves of useful information.\n\nYes, you’ll not get rid of the internal dialogue and pronunciation completely, but will learn to control and suppress interference. Just imagine that there is something in your body that is beyond the control of your will! Imagine, that the disobedient organs, the movements, that are beyond the control of the mind, are wayward horses that need to be curbed. Once you learn the methods and techniques of control, you will gain complete power over yourself and your own life.\n\nEmotions – yes, emotionality – no\n\nOf course, we experience emotions while reading. And not only. Every moment of life is associated with one or another experience – hundreds of thousands of times psychologists from around the world have spoken about this. However, the debate isn’t about whether a person is emotional or not, but about whether emotions are amenable to control. This question is closely related to the previous one, but I would like to put it in a separate rule. Excessive emotionality prevents the reader from consuming information. Instead, there is a moment of experiencing the resulting material, which is not related to the fact that you are upset from reading or fall into euphoria.\n\nIt’s difficult to experience the delight of reading while looking through the statistics report. But nonetheless. Perceiving information, it’s necessary to focus on its quality in the semantic aspect. Compare it, comprehend, digest you have time, when you familiarize yourself with the desired segment of the text. The cold mind, directed at the outer shell of the text, will not allow emotionality to overwhelm the thought process and lead it away.\n\n! Do you want to know if your job is vocation? Imagine yourself without her!\n\nBeating unnecessary thoughts\n\nIf speaking of itself slows down the pace of reading, then a high concentration of unnecessary thoughts leads exclusively to a loss of interest and a decrease in the efficiency of reading. An endless internal dialogue makes you constantly distracted by unnecessary items – how to answer a colleague's unpleasant comments, how to cook dinner ... the list is as endless as the stream of thinking.\n\nBy practicing meditative exercises to stop internal dialogues in conjunction with breathing techniques, you can not only control your thoughts during speed reading, but also focus entirely on the important points of life – during a business lunch, on a romantic date or an official celebration.\n\nConcentration depends on the goals with which you proceed to reading this or that material. Be clear about what you want to get from the text – new information, entertainment, useful data. Reading aimlessly is the same as rolling a bicycle in an unknown direction. On the way to the bakery, you can easily turn the wrong way and find yourself in another city. Adventure scenes in real life rarely turn into practical use, so choose your books wisely, relying on your own needs.\n\nEvaluate books for their worth\n\nA completely logical continuation of the usefulness of books follows from the previous secret, basically – theirs content and characteristics. Any text has a kind of image, which can be seen by previewing it. The daguerreotype of information is imprinted in the brain, which in the process of speed reading will help to recognize words and not to read them.\n\nStudying the content, reading reviews and a brief description will help to understand useful and “empty” chapters or parts of the text. Brains will tune to the desired wave and will not allow interference.\n\nSystematic training\n\nThe systematic approach is one of the main guarantees of the success of speed reading training. Each simulator and methodology in this book were selected in such a way that, after passing through each of them, not only the quality of reading, but also the quality of thinking would increase.\n\nStop is automatic degradation. Imagine, that just one day of laziness (assuming that you don’t have enough will power) can reduce many months of training to zero.\n\nIf you feel tired, reduce time on the simulators, pay less time for classes, but be sure to read the text every day – novels, newspapers, articles, essays, personal memoirs – the information will not allow the thinking mechanisms to “rust”.\n\nI brought trainings to more than four-hour process. For beginners, I recommend the maximum of 2-3 hours, so as not to overstretch the visual system.\n\nAlso I want to warn about one danger. One day you’ll not see improvements. You’ll have a feeling that you are stuck. No progress. This may take some time, but another day you’ll make a breakthrough. It's unavoidable. The main thing – at the moment of weakness, don’t give up. This time is necessary for your brain to adapt to new conditions and pace. As soon as neural connections get stronger, progress will amaze you with its scope.\n\nIntense training\n\nOur brain is a muscle that requires constant exercise. Thanks to constant exercises, new neural connections are formed, providing a high intensity of thought processes. Just like our body, the brain may experience fatigue after intense exercise. If after passing the simulators you experience headaches, do not be intimidated. Remember that if, after classes in the gym, you notice painful sensations in the arms, legs or the press, it means that the training was successful. There is a period of progress.\n\nGive yourself a rest in one or two days. Wait it out. Catch your breath. Do relaxation exercises. Neural connections will be strengthened, and you will be able to continue at a qualitatively new level, striving for even greater heights.\n\nThe right mood\n\nThe energy field is equally important in the reading process. A positive attitude helps achieve more tangible results. If you are positive, the text will turn into a source of endless joy and fascinating information for you.\n\nBe sure to try on all simulators to achieve maximum results. Set all new and new records.\n\nSimulators \"Green Dot\" and \"Apple\" are very important simulators, and when you will be engaged in speed reading skills training, don’t ignore them. The viewing time is 15 minutes, but sometimes it is useful to try one hour. Only then you feel how attention and concentration have improved. Master of martial arts Bruce Lee forced himself to look at a burning candle for 2 hours to improve concentration.\n\nIt’s necessary to train about 2 hours a day, but I sometimes trained more than 4 times, thanks to it I discovered new abilities and moved to a new level.\n\nIn order to get rid of pronunciation, it’s necessary to tap the rhythm on the simulator from 20 to 100 hours. It depends on the individual psycho-emotional characteristics of a person. You can, of course, not tap out, and force yourself not to pronounce words by force of will, but it’s very difficult. In the reading mode of automatic stream, you can read books and at the same time tap the rhythm on the table or even on your own lap with both hands. But with a simulator, it’s best to do it with two thumbs.\n\nUse all the features of the simulator to the maximum. Try to read books during workouts with a speed exceeding yours three times, thus you set yourself up at a higher pace. Understanding at the first stage is not required, it will come later.\n\nSimulators are reading weights. Catching on them and going to the plain text, your reading speed will automatically increase gradually. Don’t regret time for training, you will gain a skill that will stay with you forever. You can develop it using the proposed program to incredible heights.\n\nA very effective method of \"lasso\": You try to throw a lasso to the text and extract the whole meaning and the main idea from it. Continue to read on and on. Soon you’ll understand, that it works and it is not so difficult to undergo training.\n\nThe most important and effective weapon is to read the text as if with the tip of nose, and while concentrating on the crown of the head, press the tongue to the teeth. Your nose is a pointing stick, information, the meaning of the read should fall from the text directly into the brain in the upper part of the head into the crown. The look should be a little distracted, defocused, the reader should try to cover the maximum paragraph for himself, both in width and height, constantly increasing it. While reading, to catch this state, by force of will, to force yourself not to pronounce the text, but to extract from the text only the meaning, thoughts of the author. Read the next, throwing a lasso to draw thoughts from the text, and so on. Reading is a continuous stream. In order to easily catch such a state, daily meaningful training is necessary. Only then, after the work done, you will be able to receive not only benefit from reading books, but also pleasure, reading turns into a pleasant pastime, your eyes don’t get tired when working with a book. You read hundreds of pages without fatigue, the lesson can drag on for hours. The main thing is to believe in yourself and in your own strength, and you will definitely succeed. Reading quickly is not a myth. The law, when quantity goes into quality, hasn’t been canceled. Good luck with your speed reading skills. I hope that the time spent on classes will not be in vain and will help you succeed in any field of activity, no matter what you choose. Never give up.\n\nAfter very intense training, you may have a little headache, the upper part in the area of ​​the crown, don’t be intimidated by this state, take a break for 1-2 days. Your neurons are searching, breaking through new connections. That’s happens after physical training – muscles can also hurt. Recovery will not take long, and after the rest you will move to a new level.\n\nWhile reading, there must be a positive attitude that you quickly read, memorize the necessary information and store it in long-term memory. First, spend some time adjusting, and then proceed to reading –  this will help to greatly improve the result. During reading, there should be a goal, that you quickly read and remember and that you need this information very much.\n\n! Remember, the path of change is the way to the victory pedestal.\n\nAnother very effective and efficient way to focus attention before training is not very intense exercise, holding your breath, laying down and other physical exertion causing mild fatigue, they help you learn to concentrate better.\n\nSpend some time adjusting before exercises. Calm the breath, bring it to the correct rhythm. Do some training – squats, pushups, the bar – endorphin from physical exertion will allow the brain to relax and better absorb the resulting material. A few minutes of meditation on concentration and attention will facilitate the acquisition of information.\n\nBelieve in yourself\n\nBelief in yourself is almost the most important engine in the direction of success. I wrote this book with faith in each of my readers. And I want to convey at least a small part of the self-confidence that I feel at the moment!\n\nConclusion\n\nI honestly do not like this word. Conclusion can only be called something that is complete, but the book I created for you is endless, like any other way of learning. Therefore, on the last page I want to write:\n\nA starting point\n\nThis is where your journey begins. The book turned out to be completely different from my original intention. The topic of speed reading has developed for me in the wide range of its potential. Most likely, this option will be supplemented, overgrown with new facets.\n\nHaving read the Speed ​​Reading to these page, you can postpone some of its chapters for a couple of months. Focus on practices and exercises. Systematically practice, training each of the skills – reading without articulation and regression, concentration and attention, expand the field of view and learn to look with a defocused look, take control of your inner monologue and develop long-term memory.\n\nAfter a few months, reread the first section and try to notice, how close you are to the bar, I set for you at the beginning. I am sure, that if I could infect you with the idea of ​​mastering speed reading, your world has already changed.\n\nAnd finally, I didn’t forget my promise. In Chapter 4, I asked a question: why are you reading this book? and gave my word to answer it. Yes, the right answer exists, but I don’t need to tell you the answer. Of course, I could say that you have already found it and it is own for everyone, but this is not quite so.\n\nThe answer to this question was already in your head as soon as you opened the book. It’s simple – you want to change. You want something more to come into life that will contribute to the development of personality and the expansion of boundaries.\n\n! If change doesn’t bring pain, then nothing changes.\n\nEven without knowing that there is a magic mountain in the world, you are already striving to climb its peak. Speed ​​reading is not just a technique, it’s a philosophy of changing, changing the usual view of the world. The speed reading technique is a challenge that I once threw down to myself and did not lose.\n\nI wish you only progress, without regressions, with the confidence that you and only you can change yourself!\n\n\n","content_spans":[{"span_class":"class android.text.style.StyleSpan","start_index":0,"end_index":38,"style_type":1},{"span_class":"class
